The Garden
 
Chapter 1  Grayville.
 
There was once a place that wasn't really a place at all. You couldn't find it on a map and it was said that no boats or planes or trains could take you there. In fact, it was said that no race, no matter the pace, could get you to the gates of this placeless place.
 
But there was a girl who lived in Grayville, an entirely different place , who desperately wanted to go to this gateless, spaceless, timeless place. This little girl’s name was Madelyn and her whole life, she had heard stories about this magical place. 
 
People called it many different names, some referred to it as the land of rainbows, others dubbed it utopia, and yet other others called it "happy place" (although most of the other others were grayball players…)
 
There were plenty of rumors about a beautiful garden. They spoke of cool rocks and winding rivers you could play in for hours. They spoke of trees and bushes that grew all sorts of tasty treats. Others claimed there were millions of colorful, good smelling flowers.  Some even said the wind played music as it danced through the reeds. But everyone agreed that this placeless place, had beauty beyond compare. So, for the purpose of our story we'll call it, The Garden.
 
Some would argue that Grayville is a much better “place” than the garden. It does, after all, have much more placeness. You could find it on a map. Boats, trains, and planes could get you there. You could even run a fast paced race to get to its gates. As you might have guessed though, Grayville gets its name from its color. All of the buildings are gray. All of the objects are gray and all of the people in the town are gray. 
 
Of course the people aren't literally gray... that would be ridiculous. They just have a lot of… grayishness You see, the Grayville way of life has no whites and no blacks. They never use their make believers, they only want the facts. In fact, there was only one night each month where Grayvillites were known to really let loose. It was when the moon reached it’s grayest grayness that every person in town would put on their best suits and boots and choose a side for which to root. 
 
Now, for you or for me, grayball would not be a spectacular spectacle to see. Two players stand by a line and on top of their head was a plastic, upside down fish bowl that they always wore… even to bed! Then with a clack, and a bang, and sometimes a whoosh, they would knock their noggins together. Eventually of course one noggin knocker would knock out the other. (It was later found that banging heads together isn’t good for your brain which created the common saying, “that was dumber than a knocked-out noggin knocker.”) If you were very quiet, you could hear the townspeople let out a happy sigh if their side had won. Grayball matches are the most exciting happenings of all that happens in Grayville. So even though everyone in Grayville had heard about the garden that had never been seen, they didn’t much care, or so it seemed.
 
But you and I know that seemings aren’t always so. You see, while everyone in town was watching Grayball, poor little Madelyn sat under a tree trying to see what the others thought could never be. The Garden. 
 
The one place where she could truly be free. For Madelyn wasn’t like the others in Grayville. She wasn’t happy with a “happy sigh”. She wanted a happy whisper and a happy voice and, although she’d never admit it, even a happy shout!  The law was very clear in Grayville though “shout = out”. And so Madelyn sat under a tree trying to see a place with no placeness that no one had seen. She could see the grass, and the rivers, and the trees, and the rocks and even the bees, but they were always gray, not pretty, not ugly, always just gray. 
 
She watched as the people drained out of the stadium like fish from an aquarium whose bottom had broken. She noticed for a moment the children with their parents as they went back to their homes. She, it seemed, was the only girl who would be staying alone that night. She had never really known a true home. The whereabouts of her parents were unknown she’d been told. I’m sorry to say that Madelyn had never been in the presence of loving and caring parents, years ago they left her alone in someone else’s home. 
 
It’s a well known fact that a house is not the same as a home which is precisely why her thoughts always seemed to roam to the garden, a place she hoped could be a home of her own. She didn’t know where to get started though. Sad to say, she couldn’t even imagine a world filled with colors other than gray. There was only one place in Grayville, one and no other that she could find a tiny bit of color.
 
There was an old man at the edge of town who had lived there longer than most could remember. And he wore a bright red brooch every Sunday in October, November, and sometimes December! He was kind and he was wise and as far as nice guys went, you’d have to travel to the farthest reaches of of the land to find another with the kind of eyes you’d see when he smiled. As far as friends go, well he was as close as Madelyn had to any of those. 
 
Madelyn had never asked him about the broach before. She didn’t quite know why, but when he wore it the smile in his eyes seemed to fade for a while. She supposed, since he had chosen not to disclose the story before, it would be rude for her to ask more, but the old man was her only hope of finding the Garden. He was the only place she knew to get started. 
 
As Madelyn made her hasty approach the old man smiled and gave a great wave. But when she asked how to get to the garden, she watched the old weathered smile begin to harden. It seemed he’d come to regret the great wave he just gave.
 
“I once took a look for the place you call “garden”. I wanted pleasure and wealth and even some stardom, but then I got burned and I quickly learned that it was a place I ought not to have sought.” Madelyn looked down utterly disheartened.
 
Perhaps it was the way her gaze fell to her shoes or perhaps because he drank 2 glasses of gray goose juice, either way he quickly rethunk the thoughts he ought not to have spoken. “Dear girl, I must beg your pardon, I fear I have darkened your quest before it got started.” His hardened face gave way to a sad sort of smile and a twinkling in his eyes.
 
“Sit on this seat, kick up your feet, and I will tell you a story of great adventure and great sorrow, but listen quite carefully because this is a story I will not repeat. Not once. Not ever. 
 
Madelyn sat so quickly she nearly tipped the chair. She suddenly felt a feel she couldn’t describe, like butterflies flying inside her insides. “When I was a bit younger, I too went seeking to see what my peepers were capable of peeping. I followed the sun till it went to sleep, then followed the moon as it made its leap. I did this three times ‘till I finally found the place where the sun sinks into the ground.”
 
“As I came close, the hotness got higher until I looked out on a great river of fire. There on the bank sat a woman so fair. Her beauty so deep I could barely bare. Her voice rang out like music in the fiery air. She asked me ‘dear man what do you seek, that brings you to Redfield’s fiery creek?’ So I told her then as I am telling you now, that I wanted pleasure and wealth and stardom as well. Then tears in her eyes started to swell, one rolled off her cheek and finally it fell. ‘I’m sorry, but I have not what you seek. If your heart should shift within 500 weeks, return this to me and I’ll show you the way.’ She bade me approach and unbrooched her brooch. She broke it in two and placed one on a blanket in a basket. She gave it to me, and started to weep.”
 
Madelyn felt something sadder than sad, a feeling much stronger than she’d ever had. She badly wanted to know what else was in the basket, but she decided it was better not to ask. “It seems my dear girl that your time is quite timely.  It might just be luck, but I find it unlikely. For tonight is the first night of the 500th week.” He unpinned his brooch and pinned it again on Madelyn’s dress right under her chin. “Go to the fair lady and speak what you seek and see if she’ll guide you across that hot creek. Please tell her from me that I found my desire. It was the love of an angel surrounded by fire.”
 
 
Chapter 2  Redfield.
 
A wise man once wrote; “there are two types of being confused, one where you know it, the other where you don’t”
 
Madelyn didn’t. When she left the old man, she felt as if all her knowings had been unknowed. She sat by an old oak tree wishing in a way that people only wish a handful of times in all of their lives that there was some way to find the garden. Now that she knew the path, she started to wonder if she had wished too wishingly? She was told about angels and fire and LOVE! She felt so many feels that nothing seemed real. Then, one little feel snuck in with the rest. It sat like a tiny star in the sky.
 
And then it got bigger… And then it got bigger… And then it got bigger… 
 
Until it was the only feel that Madelyn was feeling. You see, fiery angels of love are all well and good, but Madelyn was still quite… well… gray. How could one so gray possibly hope to ever fit into a world full of color? Perhaps she should do what any other, good, gray girl would. Start living the life that they said she should. 
 
You may have already felt the same feel. If you haven’t I promise that one day you will. There may come a time when life seems quite crazy, it could be tomorrow or not till your eighty, so perk up your ears and listen very closely. You may be sad, you may be lonely, and even your home may not feel so homey, but no matter how gray you may be on the in or the out, it’s never too late to choose a new route. When Madelyn found out what I’m talking about, deep from within came a very happy SHOUT!
 
——
 
And that’s when it happened… Every person in Grayville became suddenly aware that Madelyn dared to do what she dare! As I’ve told you before, Grayvillites can be a bit of a bore. They never use their make believers, they only want the facts. The truest fact they knew in this world was the law of the land which read “shout = out”. When they witnessed the act of this strange little girl they came to a conclusion shockingly fast. So with great care and great tact they asked that Madelyn’s bags be packed and told her “goodbye, please don’t come back.” And so it seemed Madelyn’s past had passed as she scurried to pack in a hurry because the sun was just about to start its own journey. 
 
Madelyn could stop by to visit old man before leaving. Opportunity to set up grandpa.
 
You’ll need to know a bit more about Grayville for what’s in store. Beyond the gray people, gray objects and buildings was the gray meadow and the gray steeple. And if you cared to dare (or dared to care) far past the steeple the gray forest lay there. I know what you’ll ask, so please save your breath. You’re curious about what’s beyond the gray forest I’d guess. If from the edge of the trees a stone were to be thrown, everything past that was completely unknown. And strangely enough throwing a stone was exactly what Madelyn was doing.
 
Everything had been wonderfully exciting as she walked past the steeple, although she was a little sad at leaving the gray people. But here she stood at the edge of the unknown, a place beyond where anyone else had ever gone. Wondering… was it bad? Was it good? She hadn’t realized she’d been wondering out loud. When one of the trees… bowed! And then… it started to TALK! As you can imagine she was shockingly shocked.
“Excuse me little girl, for my roots are quite unruly. I hope it’s not them that caused you to stop. I assure you my dear, they are passable with one tiny hop. You see this is my spot and since me you are not, it would appear this is not the spot for you to stop.” Madelyn was frozen on the spot. Now, there are lots of languages throughout the world, but from Amerise to Zedish, not a one contained a word that could possibly describe the thoughts that bounced through her thinker. Even if one did, you’d need an entirely different word for what happened next.
 
“I know that this is not quiet polite,” said the tree in a most gracious manner, “but I heard your wonderings and may have some answers. You happen to be the second wondering wanderer to wander this way. I’ll tell you the words that he heard me say… ‘You already know what you call the unknown, but you don’t know the things you think that you know.’ Then with a crack and a snap he stood up just like all the other trees, leaving Madelyn wondering if she had really seen what she’d seen? That tree…  she thought. …drank more sap than he ought. Then she left the tree and the thought behind. Can you guess what came to her mind…?  “THE UKNOWN”.  For there in the path was the stone she had thrown! 
 
Strangely, the path continued on past the stone into the unknown.  The path hadn’t lost any of its pathness. It’s dirt was just as dirty, it’s curves were just as curvy, even the steepness was still pretty much… flat. So she reached down real-deep inside and without a peep she made the leap over the stone and into… “The Uknown”! When she opened her eyes she looked all around to see what had never been seen! She could see the grass, and the rivers, and the trees, and the rocks and even the bees… and they were all just as gray as she’d known them to be. Indeed, She knew them all very well.
 
Into her thinker came the words of the tree. ‘You already know what you call the unknown, but you don’t know the things you think that you know.’ Madelyn had to agree that she knew many of the things that were in the unknown, but how could you possibly not know what you know??
 
Or perhaps she had unknowingly not known the things back at home?? 
 
Madelyn ran into a problem then, one that you will likely run into now and again. You see, a whole lot of thoughts got tangled in her thinker, but thinking wasn’t making them any clearer. What she thought was helping was not, a hundred threads of thought all tied in a knot. Madelyn discovered something very important: It wasn’t about figuring it out. Sometimes the only thing you need to know is to follow your nose and beat your feet to see what you learn and greet who you meet. The trick to tangles is looking from different angles. Madelyn laughed at her ‘knotty’ thoughts and started to walk, deciding it might be best to have no more knowns for now.
 
Sometimes the path went up, sometimes down, and Madelyn could swear one time it went round. Just like the path, the sun and moon went round and round too, sometimes up and sometimes down. Until, on the third time around, a different light covered the ground. The light was RED! 
 
Now, take a moment and picture in your head all I’ve just said. You see, for people like us who have yellows and oranges and blues and greens, RED ground would not be so exciting to have seen, but Madelyn had never seen a yellow or a green or even a blue. Until now, grey was the only color she’d known and now this amazing new hue lit up everything in view. It took 10 blinks and twice as many winks to believe what she peeped to be true. I tell you this now only because of what happens next and what happened was…
 
“YOUNG GIRL! What do you seek that brings you to Redfield’s fiery creek.” A booming voice spoke from the deep. The old man had told of fire and desire, but the inferno raging ahead was neither. There in the center of a great river of heat sat a woman, a beauty no description completes. Suddenly, from the hottest spots, burst mountainous, fountains of fire!  “I asked you girl, what do you seek!” 
 
“The Garden” Madelyn squeaked, “The Garden is what I seek at your creek.” And to Madelyn’s surprise, the terrible beauty started to weep. Great drops of fire fell from her eyes.
 
“Why do you cry?” asked Madelyn. The lady looked up and got to her feet. She walked with no shoes, no boots, no sandals on heat as hot as ten thousand candles. And as she approached Madelyn could see on her dress one half of one brooch. “It’s been 500 weeks since last I cried, your answer, The Garden, is why.” 
 
“Please my dear girl, sit and we’ll share our worlds. My name is Annabelle, but please call me Anna. I’ve been living for years in the land and tonight I’ll make glass out of sand. Tonight is my heart’s last night I fear. It would appear, that fate has brought you a day too late.  
 
When I was your age or perhaps a year more I too dreamed of the thrilling things life had in store. I too sought the garden, same as you. I met a boy and a strange yearning started churning within. He promised we’d journey to the garden together. Perhaps I was too young, too naïve, but I wanted to believe all the things he deceived. He told me one day we’d go to the Garden to find pleasure and wealth and stardom, but somehow the start never seemed to get started. My heart became heavy. Too heavy to bare. So I gave it to him for safe keeping and care. He found his way to stardom and wealth. If they brought him pleasure, you’d have ask him yourself. He left me, and gave my heart as payment to forget me. When I asked the buyer why, she looked at me funny and told me he’d sold the heart I gave him, because he thought it was just a brooch.” 
 
Madelyn looked into her fiery eyes and found a surprise. Eyes terribly terrifying a moment ago now showed sadness, pain, hurt and loss. The thought that came into Madelyn’s thinker is quite rare. Like finding an apple in an orchard of pears. She realized if you look past angers fiery glare, most times you’ll find sadness and scaredness are there.
 
“I learned the burn of love from him. I learned that the burner never gets burnt. So I bought back my heart and returned to the start. I lit the river with flames as you can see. It’s their fire that will protect me.”
 
“I think you should have this back.” Madelyn reached into her sack, pulled out the brooch, and handed it to Anna. The sadness in her eyes seemed to grow ten times in size. Anna sighed and said;
 
“Yes… the Grayman, I take it you're friends? It seems my heart was misplaced with him. I swore I’d never let it happen again, but the look in his eyes brought up something within. His quest too was stardom and wealth, but I thought I saw something more, something else…” Her fiery eyes no longer disguised the pain and longing that lay behind. 
 
“Keep it dear girl it’s of no use to me. For tonight my fire will be hot enough for my truest desire. There’s an island in its midst and on it sits a place where my heart can truly be free. A crystal clear box with no latches, no knobs, and no key. I’ll set my true heart inside, seal it with fire and never trust another love. Then nothing will be able to hurt it, not even me.”
 
Madelyn wasn’t sure what she meant, but she did’t know the things to say to best express it especially, to a woman who can summon mountainous, fountains of fire whenever she desires! Then, before she could stop it, a saying said itself. 
 
“That doesn’t make any sense!”
 
“Excuse me?” Anna snapped. Madelyn wasn’t entirely sure what Anna wanted to be excused from or if she wanted to be excused at all in fact. 
 
“Well, it’s just that… I mean I know it’s heavy but…” Madelyn stammered. “It seems to me that it’s quite a bit of trouble to create rivers of fire from stones and ruble. So pardon me if I’m stepping out of bounds, …but it feels like the flame that surrounds us might be more painful than what it keeps out.”  She let go of the breath she was holding and took another for what comes next.
 
“I saw you walk across fire with no shoes, no boots, no sandals…
 so maybe… 
…you should find a box with handles? 
I think you can manage, you seem quite strong. And perhaps before long you’ll find a flower or a song to make it a little lighter and help you along.”
 
She let that breath go too and somehow she knew it was time for her to go. She started begging pardons and told Anna that she really must keep looking for the garden. When she was ready to leave Anna smiled and said:
 
“I wish I could be of help to you, or you of help to me, but it doesn’t appear to be. All I can tell you about what you seek is to find the sneak who sold my heart. Follow the river for 33 bends then 30,000 steps into the forest depths. There Loch Blue will find you. I vowed to never utter it again, but since you must know, his name… is Glenn.” 
 
With that Madelyn reached again into the sack, pulled out the brooch, and placed in Anna’s hands. “This does not belong to me, and I can never return it to where it’s meant to be. If you ever decide to make a box with handles, not far on the other side of the unknown there lives a man who’d be very happy to see it’s return. He gave me a message I hope will inspire. He said he found his desire. It was the love of an angel surrounded by fire.”.
 
As Madelyn looked back she could see tiny tears of fire lighting the night as they fell from Anna’s eyes.
 
 
Chapter 3 – The Winding Creek.
“Wiggle your toes or scrunch your nose or use your ear to hear what’s near. If you know you are here, and here is a where you can never be lost. Trust me I swear.” – Orvin Bluesocks, Zedish writer extraordinaire  
Walking around bend one felt like any other walking Madelyn had done. So did 2 and 3, same with 4, and more of the same in bend 5 and bend 6… Rivers and trees, rocks and sticks. 
But seven and eight started to seem strange. Her peepers gazed many new things.
When she saw the tenth bend, Madelyn felt a very strange breeze. One minute it wooshed and swooshed and the very next minute the breeze would be gone, but as Madelyn moved along one giant woosh swooshed her right off her feet! As she got to her knees Madelyn looked up to see a beautiful tree. And the tree… Sneezed! 
And when she got thirsty on bend 13, she stopped to take a drink when out burst a rabbit! She could swear he was giving her a very scary, hairy, hare stare. She was deciding that hare’s don’t stare she was seeing more than was there when he looked square at her and told her he thought she’d already stayed in his bend much longer than she ought.  At least that’s what she thought she thought, but she was quite thirsty and it was quite hot. 
At sixteen, the sticks seemed to push themselves up and crawl across the path then fall into stacks. At nineteen she was greeted by nighttime and on bend twenty, nighttime gave her the gift of sunshine which sent her heart soaring…
because at bend 21…
she met morning! 
Morning has a glory unlike any other in this story. I’ll tell you a secret and suggest that you seek it. If you wave to morning with the palm of your hand as her light sweeps the darkness away like sand, she’ll give you some goods and sweep out some bads. She’ll trade you some happy if you give up some sad. So Madelyn did, and you know what? It didn’t feel half bad.
But morning leaves soon and by bend 22 it was closer to noon. That’s when Madelyn saw a rock float up like a balloon! For a second it danced with a swaying branch until one little twig danced too jiggy a jig and *POP* the dance stopped and poor Madelyn got sand in her eyes. 
At bend twenty five, Madelyn was quite surprised that it was time for the sun to say its goodbyes. When Madelyn thought about journeying alone in the dark to bend 33, she pleaded, “not just yet,” but the sun lives up, higher than the highest bird and even that bird couldn’t have heard Madelyn’s soft pleas. Madelyn sat by the river and cried.  Through tearful eyes, she watched the most beautiful sun to ever set in the skies leaving her behind with strange trees and sticks and rocks and this strange river. Madelyn shivered, and for the moment, regretted the fact she had led herself so far from home. How had she become so very alone.
But as it turns out, she was wrong. She sat at the spot where the river crashed against the rocks and felt the mist fall gently on her cheek. She shivered and wondered how many raindrops it must take to fill a river. Although most of it’s drops were churned and turned or swept to the side when the river hit the rock, some of them decided to fly. One such flier went much higher than the others. So high in fact, that it bumped its head on a leaf. It left that leaf and fell on another and then the one under until at last the drop clung to a leaf that hung no farther than two thumbs from Madelyn’s eyes. That’s when the drop said Hi!
Now if a drop were to talk to you or to me. That would be a spectacle indeed, but Madelyn had sat at a table by fire. She had heeded the words of a talking tree and heard from a rabbit who said she should just let him be. So for her a drop that talks seemed quite normal. With one last tear in her eye, she smiled and said “hello.”
“It’s okay” squeeked the drop, “you don’t have to give them back. They are yours to keep.”
“I’m afraid I don’t know what you mean,” Madelyn sniffled. “What are the they that you say are mine to keep?”
“Your tears of course. They’re yours to keep.” The drop replied with a smile.
“Well of course they are, they came from my eyes. Whose else would they be?” asked Madelyn
“Ours of course.” Chuckled the drop. “You took them when you stopped for a drink, somewhere around bend 4 I think.”
“Ours?” Asked Madelyn, for the drop seemed to be quite alone.
“Yes of course, ours…” This time the drop motioned to the river. 
“You and the River?” Madelyn puzzled. “Oh never mind, I’m here with a drop and my tears because I couldn’t find a way to be happy with gray for all those years. I left home for the unknown! And now all I know is that I miss my home.” She said as another tear landed near her foot and rolled into the river swept along by the flow. “I should have stayed with gray! I’ll never make it to bend 33. The unknown is just too scary for someone like me. How will I know if I’ve gone right or wrong?”
The drop hopped onto Madelyn’s knee. “Madelyn, do you see where the river meets the rocks?” 
Madelyn looked to where the river clanged angrily against the smooth boulders and then poured over and fell back into a peaceful drift. “At this very moment more drops are hitting that rock than the number of stars in the sky you can see with your eyes on the darkest of nights. Each of us will hit the rock on a slightly different side. Some of us will churn and turn, some will be swept to the side, and some like me, fly. So how should I know if I’ve gone right or wrong? I could have been peacefully swept to the side where I would hide from the churn and turn and very high heights.”
“I don’t know,” Madelyn sighed and sniffled “How do you know it was right to fly?”
 The drop smiled, or at least rippled in a way that looked like a smile and said softly, “It wasn’t right.”
“You knowingly chose the wrong path!?” Madelyn asked,
“No, I simply made a choice as I moved along. No one knows where each path goes. I could’ve easily gotten stuck in a tree or blown away by a sturdy breeze, but lo and behold here I am talking to you and you to me. It’s possible it would have been better for me to be swept to the side like the others you see, but the path I chose is the only path I’ll know. And in the opinion of this tiny drop, there’s nowhere I’d rather be than here in this spot.” 
Madelyn smiled and they both watched the river in silence for a while till finally the drop continued to talk. “The river I came from is no longer the one you see. In fact, if you stepped in with your toes the river you know would be gone before the water came up to your knee. The same is true with you and me. We will never be the same as we used to be. You’re not even the same you who I knew when we first met. There’s new thought’s in your thinker I’ll bet. Don’t worry if the path you took was wrong or right just think of the choices you can still make tonight. You can sit right here and give back all your tears or you can continue your journey and face your fears.” 
With a drop, hop and tiny splash, he was back in the river and Madelyn made the choice to continue on her path. So she walked by herself through lonely woods wondering about a sound she started to hear rumbling through the ground until, at last! She waved and gave morning the last of her bads. 

Chapter 4
“Hehe hehe ayeeeee hee hee” 
 an ancient Germlan phrase rarely used and commonly mistaken to mean ‘nice to meet you’, when in truth the full translation is ‘I know that I’ll love you, and I love that I know you.’
 Orvin Bluesocks “The statistics behind the mystically mis-interpreted, lingering linguistics of optimistic and altruistic creatures who live in forests, woodlands, and thickets.”
When Madelyn came around bend 32 she felt a feel that seemed to tell her what lies ahead would not lie well. She found she was now at the top of a cliff that measured three thousand, four hundred, thirty three feet and one inch.
Madelyn stood atop the cliff looking out to where the river met the sky. It had no bends or ends for as far as her peepers could peep and that was further than all the steps she’d taken from Grayville to here. 
There’s no way I can make it to the garden, I’ll never see the man who seeks stardom, the thought popped in her thinker. I’ll never meet Glenn and I’ll never see bend 33 because it’s just too far even for me. The only feel that Madelyn felt was the feeling a heart feels when it falls down inside. 
She wanted to run and she wanted to hide, but mostly she wanted to just lay down and cry. As one single tear came to her eye, she thought of the spot where she’d met the drop. She remembered him saying her tears were hers to keep and although he was the only drop she’d ever heard speak, the others had always offered her something to drink. 
In fact, she decided drops and tears are a good thing to have around. So she sniffled a bit and got up from the ground. She tipped and toed as the rumbling sound got louder, until she lay on her belly looking over at the water as it fell three thousand four hundred and thirty three feet. She winced as she watched it fall that last inch. Even up this high, the churning and turning was terribly concerning. 
Then suddenly, she saw one drop explode from a rock and rocket much higher than any other. As the drop came swooshing up to Madelyn, she heard just four words, “and sometimes” she heard as it rose, and paused for a moment between Madelyn’s eyes. “We Fly!” he said with a smile. Before he flew away Madelyn saw a reflection of a very happy face. 
For a moment she thought she had made a mistake. She couldn’t believe the reflection reflected her face. She didn’t think happy was a feel she felt as she knelt on top of the cliff. But as soon as she looked up to the sky Madelyn realized her mistake was mistaken and she knew exactly why.
As you may know the sun is quite fond of changing her clothes. She will wear orange and yellow or even white (when she’s right overhead), but on this day the sun decided that she would wear scarlet red with a crimson flair. You see, Madelyn had spent every morning since leaving the lady of fire, completely surrounded by leaves, and branches, and trees. Now that she could look out over the trees, she could barely believe the peepers in her head, that something they peeped could be so beautiful and so red.
Her peepers gazed many other new things. When she looked at the shadows that hid behind the trees, the gray was much darker than any she’d seen. When she looked at the clouds floating high overhead, there was no gray at all. White was all she saw. And when she turned and looked back she realized the shadows… were black. Even though what she saw was not what she sought, for a Garden it was certainly not, Madelyn had seen red, the bright of white, and the black of night. As happy feels welled up inside, a very happy face took one last look as the sun changed it’s red to gray and got to the business of lighting it’s day. Although she was all alone and way up high, Madelyn started to dance.
Her search for the Garden had left her disheartened and moments before she wanted to cry, but as she spun her arms through the air she couldn’t remember why. And frankly, I don’t think she cared. For you see she may have lost her way, but she’d seen so much more than plain old gray!  
Chapter 4 
 “Keep spinning that much and your mind will be spun” Madelyn’s dance was suddenly done as she searched around for what made the sound and found what it was. This time it was not a rabbit, or a drop, or a tree, it was a man that sat with his arms round his knees. As he got up and stood, Madelyn had a hunch he was up to no good.
“What’s wrong silly girl? Did I interrupt your little twirl?”
An angry feel boiled inside her insides, but Madelyn made a very tough choice and decided not to give anger a voice. She pretended that she hadn’t heard any of the absurd words she’d just overheard. “Over here” he said with a sneer “or do you have a spun mind and broken ears?” That did it. She turned on the spot and picked up a rock. “I won’t be bullied by the likes of you! You have no idea what I’ve just been through!” Madelyn said with a glare in her stare. 
“and a temper to boot. Quiet little girl. Pipe down your flute.” He chuckled, “Save the speech about how you’re big and brave. I’d rather not hear it. Frankly, I don’t really care. Be careful with that wind in your hair though, you wouldn’t want to wind up down there.” He pointed to the churn and turn below. 
“Don’t you dare threaten me! I’ll throw this I swear!” Madelyn said of the rock in her fist.
“You’re in quite the pinch.” He said more seriously than before, “One big gust and you fall three thousand four hundred thirty three feet and an inch. You’ve mistaken me. My words aren’t threatening, they’re words of warning to a silly little girl who dances atop cliffs in the morning.”
Madelyn couldn’t decide what made her more angry, the smug look in his eyes or the fact that he was right. It was quite windy, she was up very high, and unlike the drop she couldn’t fly. So she took a bite of her pride, swallowed and took a stride away from the cliff towards the man’s sneering grin. She dropped the rock by his side. “I would prefer never to see you again,” she said curtly “so I’ll walk away and ask you not to follow.”
“I beg your pardon princess,” he mocked, “but I go where I please, through rivers over rocks and under trees. I did it yesterday. I did it today. And I’ll do it tomorrow.” 
Those words brought Madelyn sorrow. She had hoped to be in the garden by tomorrow, but it seemed highly unlikely, because wherever bend 33 happened to be it was certainly not close by. As if he could read her mind the man asked “What were you hoping to see up there on the cliff before you met me?”
“Bend 33” Madelyn replied.
“Excuse Me?”
“I said that I’m traveling to bend thirty three!”
“Well, I’ll be. So tell me when you look out there how many bends are in sight.” She chanced a glance back at the cliff to see if the river had suddenly added a few twists.  
“None” Madelyn said grumpily.
“And this bend here was number 32 am I right?” Madelyn tried to hide the shock on her face. “I’d bet you’ve walked all this way to find Loch Blue, but in all this walking did it ever occur to you that you might have started at bend number 2 or 4 or 5?” Madelyn looked down thoroughly defeated.
“Aww don’t get that sad look in your eyes.” He mocked, “I’ve got a surprise for you. This is in fact bend 32 and if I’m right about who sent you, I am your bend 33. The name is Glenn, Glenn Bend and I won’t follow you, but if you behave yourself I might let you follow me.”
Madelyn looked over her shoulder to the river as it slid around the corner, through hanging branches and smooth boulders and tried to take in what Glenn just told her. Glenn was a Bend! Was this what Anna had meant when she sent Madelyn to find the thirty third bend? If it was indeed true that she’d just passed bend 32 then Glenn Bend was the only bend Madelyn could see that could possibly be bend 33. 
“You were the one who stole Anna’s heart!” Madelyn accused with a start. “You were the one who tore it apart!”
“Or so the story goes, but who knows what that bitter woman says these days, she’s blind to everything but her own misery.” Glenn retorted 
“A misery that you created. You promised to take her to the Garden! She gave you her heart so you could guard it. But what did you do? You sold it for wealth and pleasure and stardom!” Madelyn spat as she walked up to the place where Glenn sat. 
“Hahaha, silly little girl you’ve been blinded by your stay in her fiery little world. The funny thing is she’s nothing more than a cold-hearted nag deep within.”
Before she could understand what had happened her hand swung out and she slapped him. Without a flinch, his hand shot out astonishingly quick and tightly grabbed Madelyn’s wrist. No matter how hard Madelyn tried to fight free, his grip was still as tight as could be. He stood to his full height and stared into Madelyn’s eyes. Then, with a firm hold and a stern gaze he said,
“Did you think that would hurt me? Listen to every word I’m about to say clearly. It does not matter how brave you think you are inside, to the rest of the world you’re just a silly little girl in a silly little skirt. So the next time your little hand feels brave enough to slap someone’s face, you better think twice or you just might get hurt. Not everyone’s as nice as me little girl.”
“You want to go to Loch Blue to look for your garden? Fine, I’ll take you there, but let’s get one thing straight, it’s not because I care. I just don’t want it said that Glenn Bend let a silly little girl walk alone into the woods to her end. Although that’s exactly where we’re going I suspect. 30,000 steps into the darkest woods’ depths. Even if we survive the winding of blind man’s creek and the shadows of sorrow the Germlens cast before they eat, even if you make it to your precious garden, the simple fact is you won’t find pleasure. Happiness no longer exists. Now grab your bag and let’s get going. Watch out for the sticks, we wouldn’t want our little princess to trip.”
Chapter 5
Madelyn grabbed her bag and with one last drink from the river, took the first of 30,000 steps into the forest depths.
A thousand steps came and went and Madelyn couldn’t stop the thought that she ought to be more angry with Glenn for the things he had said, but strangely she was not. At first she figured it must be because he could help find the Garden, but as she kept stepping she started to think that it was something about Glenn specifically that made her something other than mad. In fact, something about him kind of made her happy inside. Madelyn walked up to Glenn’s side, “You’re not as mean as you seem,” she said. 
Glenn turned his head and looked down at her. “Oh yeah princess, How’s that?”
“When we were back at the cliff, anyone could see you were trying to be mean to me, but what really got you hot was when you thought I was behaving dangerously, dancing on heights or picking bad fights. You pretend to be so tough and cruel, but I don’t think that’s the true you. I think you care about what happens to me. I think there’s a good person inside you just wishing to be free.”
“Don’t imagine things that aren’t there. I told you the truth, I truthfully don’t care.”
“Fair enough,” Madelyn sighed and walked along at his side in silence down the path as it turned this way and that, before speaking again. “Why do you think she is blinded by her misery?” She asked about Anna.
Glenn stared at the path ahead as he said, “Who could possibly see through a wall so fiery and hot? She thinks she’s protecting herself, but she’s not. She’s just roasting in her own self-loathing. Hoping that little girls like you will pity her and do as she tells you to do. Don’t worry, she did it to me too. She chooses people and she uses us to get what she thinks she wants. And do you know what I think really haunts her in her inferno? I think she knows it’s her wind of fire that blows away any who might have the desire to make her happy.”
“Quiet now, we’re at blind man’s creek and it’s very important that you hear what I speak. They call it blind man’s creek because no one has ever seen it be crossed. In truth it’s crossed quite often, but none have ever done so with the use of their eyes. For stepping near its waters will, for a time, leave you blind. When you look from out here it doesn’t look so wide, but trust me it’s just a trick on the eyes. It’s a long way across this creek and crossing it safely requires the most unique technique. Pay attention now, you must walk exactly these steps or you will be swept away to the depths. First take one step into the water. Once you’ve taken five farther take 3 to the left and four to the front. One to the right and one behind. Then three to your side and 3 more right. Then turn to your left 5 more times and take one final step backwards out the other side. Take any other step, and you will find yourself caught in its current forever blind.”
Madelyn repeated the steps in her head as she got closer to the creek. When suddenly she shrieked! The world went black and her peepers stopped peeping! It was so scary at first she forgot it wouldn’t last. She thought she might always see black. As the thoughts in her thinker calmed down a bit, she decided to imagine she had simply chosen to shut her eyes for a time. So she took one step into the water and then five steps farther where she took one to the left, and suddenly she was swept of her feet and scuffed up her knees. More importantly, the sweep that swept her off her feet had swept her away from the step she was supposed to take next.
She stood and decided to act as if nothing had changed so she took another step left and right away she was swept to her knees. She tried again and again, but whenever she stepped to the left she stumbled, when she stepped in front she tumbled, and the one time she tried a step to the right and another behind, she wound up promptly on her backside. As she felt a single tear fall from her eye Madelyn remembered that the creek was made of drops just like the river. 
Tear drops and rain drops and dew drops too all left the river in one form or another. Whether they leaked from the sky or fell from the cheek of someone who cried. To Madelyn, it seemed the drops in the river were likely to be the same as the creek. Except of course that they had yet to speak.
If that was the case, then Madelyn figured it was safe to say that the drops also churned and turned and were swept to the side. She stood up, clenched her fist and felt the mist that proved what she implied, that the drops in the creek could also fly. When she felt the mist again she listened for the churn and heard it up ahead, so she took a step to the side instead. When she stepped to where the drops were swept to the side she shifted her weight to the right and leaped over to where it flowed a bit slower. Then quickly before her momentum could carry her forward she shifted over to her other foot and spun back around a very large boulder. So it went that with a sleek mystique all her own Madelyn danced across the creek. 
As she stepped out she heard Glenn shout “Madelyn is that you? Are you safe? Say something so I know you’re OK!”
“I’m fine she smiled, I just got knocked down a few times.”
“A few times? Knocked down? Madelyn most would have drowned! How did you know where to step after you lost your way?”
Madelyn thought of the drops and said, “I never lost my way. When I fell and scuffed my knee I lost the way you taught me, but that was your way. And even though there were a few extra ups and downs, eventually I found my own way around. Were you really worried I would drown?”
“I have to say I was wrong, you are very brave Madelyn, and very strong. But just because you dance and twirl willy-nilly in a creek doesn’t make you any less silly of a girl I think.” 
Madelyn opened her eyes and as if she had never been blind, Glenn’s face came into sight.  “Do you know what I think Glenn?” She said, “I think you were just worried about your friend.”
“This again?” Sighed Glenn. “Just hurry up before you get eaten by a Germlen.”  
“What’s that?” She asked as she sat and wrung the drops from her bag. 
“What’s a Germlen!? I wish I could say I was shocked, but I’m not. A Germlen’s one of those dangerous things you ought to have thought of before coming this way. But to answer your question, it’s hard to say since the first thing a germlen does when it meets you is eat you. If that was all that happened it wouldn’t be so bad, but before they meet you and eat you they follow behind you casting a shadow that can make even the happiest man so sad he would be glad to be eaten.”
Madelyn didn’t believe it was possible to be so defeated that instead of being sad someone would want to be eaten, but then again she had never met a Germlen or even heard of them before Glenn, which seemed to show that there was a lot about Germlens that she didn’t know. She looked up and saw that Glenn was on the path again. She was fairly certain that they were friends and he would wait for her, but once again she didn’t know. So she grabbed her bag, picked up the pace and followed.
When she caught up, she sped up, and spun around. She placed her feet firmly in the ground, blocking the path Glenn was headed down. “Are we friends?” She asked.
“Really? Again?” His voice got louder, “No we… are… not… friends!” he shouted. “I’m here because I don’t want it said that Glenn Bend let a silly girl meet an unfortunate end.” With each word she heard she became a little madder until finally she decreed, 
“As a matter of fact, I agree! We are most certainly not friends, you and me. So would you kindly stop following! I know how to go from here. Follow the path as it twists and turns, then look out for the germlens and take ninety four hundred and two dozen steps to get to loch blue. I can manage just fine without you. So, since we’re not friends and since I don’t depend on you to get where I’m going, I thank you for showing me this far, but this far has already been far too much.” Then she promptly turned her back and returned to the path. 
She was walking and wondering if she might have done something she’d soon be regretting when she heard his hurried steps. “Ok,” he said between breaths, “We’re friends, but don’t get confused on why, It’s simply because I find you amusing. I’m not a feeble little nice guy who cares about the affairs of silly little girls who want to feel the wind blow in their hair.”
“Fine, but look me in the eyes and tell me we’re friends. It doesn’t matter why.” She demanded
“Fine, we’re friends.” He said, but as he looked down Madelyn found something new in his eyes, speckled between and wrapping around for the first time ever her peepers peeped a shade of brown, a pair of brown eyes in fact! And not just any brown found on the ground they were glowing and warm like a cabin and a fire in the midst of a storm. She was wondering how colorful eyes brought so many comfortable feels when suddenly the feels were snatched back. Madelyn looked at her feet and saw black.
“Madelyn! Oh No! It’s a Germlan shadow, the shadow of sorrow” Glenn said with genuine concern. “Listen, we need to get to Loch Blue very soon. Until then, whatever you do, do not look back. You’d need to be bigger for a Germlan’s dinner, but for a snack…”
At first it wasn’t so bad. It was just a little shadow, no bigger than an apple. At one point in fact, Madelyn thought she saw two cute furry ears on top the apple sized shadow. She was tempted to look back but Glenn kept his stream of very unsightly ideas of how one might be eaten by Germlan’s flowing through her ears. She thought it was unwise, to take advice about how to survive being eaten by a Germlan or otherwise from Glenn. He himself said that if you ever saw what you’d have to see to say what he was saying then the next sight you’d see would be the last you ever saw. She was sure that meant that he had not seen any of these things at all, but there was a good chance that if she was wrong, with a bite she’d wind up right in a Germlan’s belly. So, to be safe, she decided to wait until she reached Loch Blue to get another point of view.
The shadow continued to grow though. When it got as big as a tea tray Madelyn was a little dismayed that she didn’t turn when it was small enough to kick away. By the time it sprawled around her on the path like a shadowy sleigh, she couldn’t believe that she’d ever turned away and delayed facing the apple sized creature that followed her earlier that day. Now that it had grown so big, she was certain that she’d never be able to face it and live. 
It can be safely said that many things about Germlans and their shadows remained to be seen, but Madelyn had certainly noticed some very strange things about the shadow she was walking under. First, it folded round her ears till she couldn’t hear a word Glenn uttered or any other sound for that matter. Then it sat on her head like a ten pound hat that forced her peepers to peep down at the ground. It blocked out the light on the in and the out and even morning with all her glory couldn’t shine through a shadow so deep. She couldn’t see the rocks or the trees overhead as she tripped and banged her noggin. All she could see of what the path held in store was her own two feet and two feet more. She stepped and stepped not knowing what would happen next. How could she possibly find Loch Blue without seeing further ahead than a step or two? 
But she knew that if she turned around she was through. She couldn’t imagine how bad a germlan must be to cast a shadow that can drown out everything else so thoroughly. She kept stepping even though it became much harder as the pull of the shadow got stronger and stronger like she was dragging a hundred foot blanket that kept getting longer. She got so tired that all she could do was take a few more steps and hope that one of them would bring Loch Blue into her 2 foot view of two shoes. But the shadow snagged on every twig and branch until Madelyn fell right on the grass by the path. She was trapped for a time staring at a very small patch of very gray grass when she finally decided that whatever she saw when she turned around would be better than staring forever at gray grass on the ground. She turned with both peepers tightly shut and although she was certain it was going to hurt to get eaten, she opened her peepers and peeped her very first germlan!
There on the ground was a little brown creature the size of an apple but fluffy on all sides. On top of its head were two little ears, in the middle were a pair of eyes that looked like a puppies, but twice the size, and under those eyes a button nose and a tiny smile. Madelyn watched with concern for a while as the germlan sat there and smiled, to see if it would gobble her up. Until finally she heard a tiny little hiccup and decided not to try to hide the smile that was growing wide across her face. Having reasonably assumed that there was no pending doom, Madelyn turned to stand and gasped when she saw that the grass her hand grasped was another color she hadn’t known before.
It seems to me that at this point one might think the color was green. After all, green is a very grassy color to be. But one should think twice. For you see, grass comes in many more colors than green. There are grasses of yellow and brown and oranges, but this particular grass was a cool shade of blue. A color that until now Madelyn never knew. 
“They really are misunderstood,” a voice said next to Madelyn and she suddenly realized she’d been so focused on the brown germlan on the ground and the blue grass growing all around that she hadn’t even glanced the small man to her side wearing blue socks, a blue hat and a blue pair of pants. 
“I describe it in great detail in my guide to Curbing the Disturbing Burdens of germlan Uncertainty. The entire confusion is based on unproven conclusions about the reunions of Germlans and humans: 
‘Although it is commonly assumed that a woman named Susan ran into a Germlan and got eaten. In reality, he was just trying to amuse Susan when she saw that a tooth in his smile had started to loosen. When she tried to see if he was losing any other teeth he hiccupped and the movement gave Susan a bruise on the tip of her finger. However, over years of repeating the story escalated to him making her his dinner.’ I don’t think I could have written it any clearer, but somehow people still shake with fear when a germlan is near.”
Madelyn picked one of a hundred questions bouncing in her thinker and said, “so it never would have eaten me? The shadow it cast seemed very beastly.” 
“On the contrary, a germlan has only two desires. One is to give comfort to someone who’s tired and the other is to show them a bright sunny smile. Their shadow is a very special gift for someone who can’t sleep. It hides your eyes from light that’s too bright and muffles your ears so loud noises won’t interfere. Eventually it becomes like a blanket, where no matter how hard you yank it, you’ll still be safe and snug inside. He’s followed you for many miles and since in that whole time you walked away from the light and the sunshine towards nighttime, he presumed to assume you must be very tired. The whole while all you had to do was turn back to the light and the shadow would be replaced by a bright sunny smile.”
“Well now that I know that,” Madelyn said as much to herself as to anyone else, “I just need to find out why I’m sitting on blue grass in the middle of the woods with a man in blue socks, blue pants, and a blue hat, where my friend Glenn has been, and how to get back to Loch Blue after that.” 
“Lucky for you this man in blue pants can help answer what you ask. To begin, I the man in that hat, am Orvin Bluesocks, Zedish writer extraordinaire. The grass that grows on the ground is the start of Loch Blue which you’ve already found. As for your friend Mr. Bend, he’s quite safe and sound, but I regret that he will not be able to join us for what lies ahead.”   

Chapter 
“Where is my friend Glenn?” asked Madelyn as they passed through the blue trees and the blue grass. 
“I’m afraid Mr. Bend is not welcome in Loch Blue. I assumed you knew. He’s a thief and sneak and sometimes downright mean too. Not the sort you should be sorting with if you know what I mean. The last time he was seen, he had stolen a poor girl’s heart and broken it apart. Not a very nice thing to do.” Orvin answered.
“And Mr. Bluesocks, sir, did you know her? The girl who’s heart he stole and sold?”
“You know Madelyn, you’re not the first little girl I’ve found in this forest. Many years ago I was out for a saunter, pondering my new novel about the offer of Prince John the honorable to a pauper that convinced him to sell his honor for a tea cup and saucer. Cups and saucers are quite wonderful you see. Nothing better for holding your tea, but that poor pauper who sold his honor failed to see he couldn’t afford a teapot. When he asked the neighbor if they would let him borrow theirs for a spot, they said absolutely not, for they had not forgotten that his honor had already been sold and bought.”
Madelyn wondered if he remembered her question at all when he said. “Very well, it was fall. The air had not yet gotten cold, but the leaves were slowly losing their hold. One let go, and with a gentle blow landed in a basket in the grass. When I went to see what was in the basket with the leaf, I never dreamed I’d encounter the wonder I found. For when I moved the leaf there were two beautiful blue eyes, each with a tiny speck of fire staring up at me! I stayed there with her for as long as I could looking out in the wood. Wondering if there was someone out there who would claim her. But the sun slowly sank in the sky and her blue eyes started to cry the cry of a hungry little girl.”
“So I took her back to my village near green mountain creek. Made sure she was fed and placed in a comfortable bed. In the morning we returned to this very spot, and for that whole day and 32 after we waited to see if somebody would come asking for her. I started to wonder what kind of walking wanderer no longer wanted their own daughter and just left her beside the water instead. So after thirty three days I raised my arms to the sky and cried ‘I want her!’ When I heard no reply, I decided that I should give her a name and take her as mine. There is a word in ancient Rumistone that took two of ours to be known. It means to celebrate and remember. That word is Anna. Her full name is Annabella, you see. It means celebrate and remember the beauty. The beauty I found in a basket in the grass on the ground. Not three feet from where you laid down.” 
As Madelyn listened to the chirp of the birds she thought a lot about what she’s just heard. “You just found her on the ground?”
“That is correct, on the ground surrounded by flowers with a neat little note that read “I beg your pardon. -The Gardener.”
“What else did it say?” asked Madelyn in dismay for surely there could be no gardener without a garden. 
“It said nothing else, but in the basket there was a small pouch that read open when you’re six years and ten.” 
Suddenly Madelyn could see through the trees to a lake of the bluest blue she knew to be true. She saw as the ripples from the moonlight bounced down from the night sky and bounced again to light the underside of the trees in a soft, soothingly smooth motion. She turned to the water, took a step, and was quite shocked that her step had been on Mr. Bluesocks sock!  He stood like a stone between her and the lake. She looked down and with a slight frown he told her, “You must seek to peek in green mountain creek before you may gaze at the lake.”
“Come with me,” he said “Let’s get you fed in a comfortable bed. Warm your heart and clear your head. Green Mountain Creek will be there in the morn.”
And fed she was from hams to jams to cottage cheese, far more than she could ever eat. When she stepped in the door Orvin’s wife Lauren was setting an extra place at the table. She took Anna’s bag and set it by a chair with a box of thimbles and needles and strings and yarn. Over the next hour she served the most delicious dinner Madelyn could imagine. And just when she thought she might pop, out of the kitchen burst Mrs. Bluesocks with a half dozen pies, all piping hot! 
After the pies she thought she’d never need to eat again in her life, but Mr. Bluesocks pulled a little tin box from the pantry where he was putting away the bread. He pulled off the top and popped a little piece of fudge into Madelyn’s mouth. To her amazement of all the tastes she’d tasted that night, the fudge was the best tasting of all. She had eaten three more pieces before Mrs. Bluesocks came back and screeched that they had eaten quite enough sweets. Mr. Bluesocks gave her a wink, and he and Lauren showed her to a bed so comfortable she could even sleep through Orvin’s Snoring.
In the morning, Madelyn woke to a bag that was patched and packed with delicious treats made from the fruit that grows on the trees of Loch Blue. As they walked toward the creek Madelyn asked Orvin “Why must I seek Green Peak Creek before I can gaze in the lake?”
“Funny you should ask, I once wrote a dissertation on the indigenous effects of indigos and violets on vision in the night time and in it I clea…”
“Mr. Bluesocks, much as I want to know what your thoughts are, we are getting nearer the creek we seek and I think it would be nice to know why in a more… well… concise manner.”
“Very well”, said Orvin his smile fading, “In order to view Loch Blue your reflection must have something blue to contribute. I have my socks and pants and hat too. Lauren has her apron and boots. Somewhere every person in town has blue. For you see if they didn’t they um, wouldn’t be allowed to, uh… well that is to say… they wouldn’t be allowed to stay.” He stammered in dismay. “You see there is no truer color than blue. And nothing can be trusted but the truth, so anyone who has none gets the blue boot so to speak.” 
Madelyn’s frightened eyes opened wide! “The blue boot?” She asked.
 “I wouldn’t worry about any of that,” He whispered, “I’ve seen in your eyes and I see you are true young Madelyn. This I promise you.” He gave her a wink, and Madelyn decided not to think of it again. After all,  Orvin was a very trustworthy man.
With that they arrived to see a rather large fellow in the shallow part of the narrow creek. He had a blue umbrella over his head and in his hand a blue drink. You won’t believe me when I tell you that the hand that grasped the drink was blue as well. In fact, in one shade or another he was blue from head to toe… and the same in reverse. 
His toes were teal! His naval was navy! His shoulders were sapphire! And his nose was indigo! He even had periwinkle, merry wrinkles surrounding his eyes, (Merry Wrinkles are a common side effect to too many smiles.) Madelyn was willing to bet he sat on a big blue bottom too. He bellowed from his blue belly as he exclaimed loudly “It’s a great day to be blue don’t you think?” The sound seemed to echo off the rocks around them.
“Mr. Blue It’s my pleasure to introduce to you, Madelyn. Madelyn this is Mr. Blue, you may have recognized him from my interview for the wildly popular article on “How to be smart from the start and not fall apart when you’re stuck in the cloud of a big blue man’s…”
“Uh hum,” Mr. Blue cleared his throat. Orvin, perhaps you should finish your introductions before discussing your publishings.”
“I was quite sure I had, Madelyn – Mr. Blue and Mr. Blue – Madelyn.”
“Yes, yes but Madelyn who? Is it Madelyn Blueshoes or bluesocks? Or by chance is it Madelyn Bluepants? Wait a moment, what have we here? Where’s your blue my dear?” He said with a smile. Madelyn stared at the ground, at her shoes, wishing they were blue, or her pants or her socks or anything at all that would let her stay where she choose. 
“Ah, I think you’ll be wanting to see to the willow then.” he said with a slightly smaller grin. ”Don’t worry, you’ll find out in a hurry if you don’t have any blue. And if you don’t you’ll never know the difference!” He chuckled. “You’ll wind up right next to the first steps you took to Loch Blue unable to remember a word any of us has spoken to you.” Another great laugh rolled past his round face. “Which knowing Orvin the way I do, may be a blessing for you!” 
“Well now, there’s no point in delaying the inevitable, your blue is either acceptable of forgettable. Regrettably, from what I see, your blueishness is quite negligible, but that’s why I stay in the creek helping travelers find what they seek and leave the choice of who is eligible to a more credible professional.” He followed this with a very hearty laugh. Madelyn smiled back at him, but inside she was happy to hear that this jolly blue man would not be the one to decide if she could stay in this land. As Madelyn and Orvin set off across the tiny bridge Madelyn looked down and caught Mr. Blue’s eyes. Her peepers peeped a surprise. Mr. Blue had eyes of gray. 
They were beautiful and deep, but they were certainly not blue.  They were such a glossy gray that she could see her own face and his face too, which is why if you looked at him from any other way you’d think they were as blue as the sky on a sunny day. But behind the rays of blue, those glossy gray eyes looked like they were about to cry. 
Madelyn felt a longing feel. She wanted to find out what was going on inside. What was hiding in those eyes, but that feel was drowned out by a mountain of fear the she was very near to being kicked out. Madelyn would have no protection from a reflection. There was nothing blue to reflect. “Orvin” Madelyn questioned as they followed the creek into a small canyon. “Do Mr. Blue’s eyes seem…”
“Sad to me?” He answered, “Yes, I agree. In fact, he inspired the lead character in my novel entitled, ‘Mr. happy and the very sad tune.’ It’s Mr. Blue’s job to greet who he meets by the creek and try to ease their nerves before they return to seeking what they seek. If you ask me, it sounds like a lonely endeavor when the only people you’ll ever meet are nervous about finding what they seek.”
Suddenly, Orvin stopped where the path was blocked again by the creek. “I cannot cross.” claimed Orvin. “Sure you can!” Madelyn said as she ran and hopped across the creek. “It’s easy just follow my lead.” 
“Would that I could my love, but I can’t. The crossing may be easy, but the willow is just beyond that hill, so this is as far as I go.” With that he reached across the creek, squeezed Madelyn’s hands and gave her a wink, then walked to a shady spot and sat down, presumably to wait until she came back around. Madelyn had a sinking feel that he might be waiting forever.
Wherever this endeavor took her however she would be grateful for his hospitality and for happily treating her like she was a part of the family. She wished she could remember this after the willow sent her back to the start (for she feared that was exactly where she was going). So with sad feels and a shrinking heart Madelyn started up the hill. When she got to the top she thought her heart had stopped altogether. There where she stared was the most beautiful tree she’d ever peeped. It was a glimmering sort of blue. It’s drooping branches spanned the canyon from side to side and blocked out the site of whatever was behind. 
As she approached, she noticed the leaves were lightly glowing and slowly opening. In a minute or two or maybe one more, there in front of her, was a door. She tried to peep through, but all she saw was deep, dark blue. Outside the sun was finishing her daily ride, and she started to see the light of the moon. So, not knowing what else to do… she stepped through.
“Where is your blue?” a wispy wind seemed to whisper as it blew. 
Madelyn sighed and replied, “To tell you the truth, I’m not sure I have any blue.”
“I can be the one to decide,” said the breeze as it blew through the great tree. “Turn so I can see you on all sides.” Madelyn twirled and giggled thinking of her dance on top of the cliff. “Why do you smile? There’s no blue on your sides, your front or your back.  If I can’t find any, I’ll send you back, back to the beginning.” 
Madelyn thought about what it would be like not to remember the Bluesocks or Mr. Blue and quickly grabbed her bag and dumped it out. She slumped down waiting for the willow to throw her out. “I have bad news for you,” said a cool draft as it passed. “There is no blue in that bag. I am afraid I must take you back.”
“Wait! If it’s true that people with blue can be trusted, then I can be trusted too. Orvin Bluesocks looked in my eyes and said I was true and even though I know it will cost me memories and friends, I was honest about not having blue too!” There was a gusting gasp as each branch in the tree twisted and snarled into a jagged shadow. The leaves that lay so peacefully a moment before were now swirling and storming all around. As they blew by her ear she could hear them argue in dismay. “She’s lying” one whispered. “Mr. Bluesocks Too” said another. Then “Mr. Bluesocks has Blue.”, and “Blue is True”, “ They began circling faster and faster and as all the blue flittered passed Madelyn couldn’t help herself, once again she began to dance. Twirling with her arms stretched wide in blues like the sky, for a moment it felt like she could fly. Now they began to howl! “You said He was blue!”, “You said She wasn’t true!”, and finally, “Maybe blue isn’t the same as the…”   Suddenly with a swoosh and a poof, they all blew, and flew far up into the might making the stars twinkle in the sky. When Madelyn looked down she found she was standing by a river in the soft night breeze that now seemed to be blowing quite silently. 
“Madelyn, my girl, my darling girl,” Said a soft voice from a woman who floated on a tiny little lake that moments before was hidden by the willow. Madelyn walked to the bank and sat down. “Do you know what you’ve done dear girl? You’ve lifted the curse that’s haunted my world! Oh but I must find me and remind me of what I have done so blindly, what I’ve lost and the cost I must pay.”
Madelyn didn’t follow the words she was saying, but she couldn’t look away. This blue beauty was standing on the lake much further than would be safe if she sank. But she didn’t sink, in fact, it looked to Madelyn as if she was part of the water. As she walked farther towards the shore Madelyn would have sworn that the blue lady was much more clear than blue. Madelyn had seen that sheen before, in the drop she met when she had stopped and wept on the bend. As the lady smiled, Madelyn realized the only blue she had were her eyes. 
“I must follow the flow back to my home,” the lady said, “but I want you to know that your honesty will show. So return to loch blue, tell Mr. Bluesocks I remembered and will return to celebrate soon, and then tell him to let you gaze in the lake. When everyone knows you are true, you must tell them these three things exactly. So listen close to what I tell you: Tell them the willow has made them blind. Tell them you have lied. Most importantly, they must look  to the mountain at sunrise. When I find me, I’ll come back and find you.” And with that and a splash Madelyn found she was again sitting alone and very confused on the ground. As she turned around she couldn’t ignore the feel that she had peeped that face before.
She heard Orvin’s snoring before she saw him across the clearing, hunched peacefully beneath a tree. The moon was brightening the sky as she shook him awake. “For Blueness sake that was frightening” he declared when he saw she was safe. 
“Mr. Bluesocks, I met a lady up there who told me to tell you that you should remember to celebrate taking me to the lake.” Madelyn puzzled. “Wait, I may have made a mistake, maybe you’re supposed to remember you’re blind while I lie at the lake. Oh I honestly don’t know, it’s hard to keep her words straight.” Madelyn said more than a little frustrated.
“Either way child,” Mr. Bluesocks said with a smile, “we had better get you to Loch Blue.”
As they made their way back to the lake Madelyn looked again into the eyes of Mr. Blue as they passed, but this time she stopped and asked, “Mr. Blue, is it lonely being only you that stays here day after day?”
“Well, it gets a little lonely inside sometimes,” he said with a very big smile “but I greet everyone who passes with a smile and a wave to lighten their burden for what lay ahead. The same on the back of course.” He smiled even more, “Although it gets lonely some days, the truth is without this I’m sort of a waste. My smile and my laugh are my only saving grace. They distract from my eyes which you’ve apparently surmised are just gray. I paint myself a brighter blue each day so the reflection will stay.” He said as his smile started to fade. He must have realized the look on his face though for he laughed very loudly and said, “It’s a good thing they do because no one likes gray! I see you too must have found some blue, since you’re not back where you started!”
“I’m afraid you aren’t seeing clearly. I’m not blue, and I’m also not where I started. In fact, I’m mostly gray with some reds and browns, but I’m certainly still around. So, you can tell everyone you know that you don’t have to be blue to be true. The willow is no more. Look to the mountain in the morning and you’ll find what I found.” Madelyn said, although she had no way of knowing if the mountain would show him anything other than what it already had in days gone past. “By the way Mr. Blue, I come from a land very far away from where you and I are now. The land is called Grayville, and it’s very well named, for the people who live there all adore gray.”
For the first time Madelyn saw his smile fade completely from his face, but it was replaced with joy and relief in his eyes. “For as long as I remember I’ve smiled on the out, but never the in. I’ve been a jolly stranger, but never a friend. To listen to you say that this land of gray really exists. A place where I might fit, even from such a distance, is a wonderful gift to be given. A gift I’m afraid I’m unable to repay at the moment, but I shall forever more be your true friend.” After much resisting and insisting on the matter Madelyn agreed that he could return the favor if they met someday later.
As the town of loch blue came into sight Madelyn could hear a distant cheer. She looked to her left to see Orvin give her a nervous grin. “Now Madelyn I should probably warn you that we may return to a rather… well… interesting situation. As I describe in my recitation on modern and ancient loch blue tribes the sole enduring tradition from bygones and bygones and even a hi-gone ago, are blue-day celebrations. The chance to celebrate the designation of someone’s confirmation from the willow that they are indeed Authentically Blue.”
“Oh,” said Madelyn, “That could be a problem.” 
“Don’t be bothered, darling child. I will stay by your side and see you through to loch blue.”
As they passed down the hill the crowd parted and all stood still to learn what on her being the willow had discerned to be blue. The crowd was blocking their way to the lake, and she could hear rumors begin to murmur. When she heard someone shout, “Wait, what did the willow figure out?” she jumped on a stump, and tried to use her loudest loud voice to speak to the people.
“People of Loch Blue!” She quickly realized her loud voice was not enough, “Excuse me!” still no luck. As she thought of how rude the people of Loch Blue were being, she felt a fiery feel rise up from the depths and fly past her lips, “YO Blue People! Close your mouths and hear me out,” she shouted in fury! They all fell silent, as she added, “Please” with a squeak.
You will find many sorts of silence in your life. Some silences feel bad, like when you’re afraid to say what you want to say, so you stay misunderstood. Others astound, like when no word heard could make your world feel better than now! There’s a third silence too, the silence when you’re not quite sure what to do, but all eyes are focused squarely on you. That was the silence that surrounded loch blue, not a single squeak other than someone or other’s Ka-Choo. A whole town of frowns stood facing her way, waiting for some explaining. 
“People of Loch Blue,” She said as calm as she could, “I went to the willow and it didn’t find any blue.”
“Why are you still here?” Someone asked. “Why weren’t you taken back?
“Well there was this lady you see, but first it got really windy and… and I didn’t know what to say because I’m still rather gray. Then everything started spinning, and I wound up at the beginning, but not the beginning from before. The beginning of what I’d just begun and…”
“Wait a second! What did you say?,” Said a little a boy in way from behind. He looked about to cry as he asked, “is the willow ok?”
“Well right before my eyes, it sort of, spun around, and well…”, she took a deep breath. “It shriveled up and blew away. But beyond the willow lay the Lady of the Lake.” She quickly added. “And she told me that the willow was making you blind and that I have um… well she told me to say that I had, well… lied and to uh… look for proof on the mountain in the morning.” She spouted out.
The crowd, that was surrounded by silence moments before, was roaring now. “She killed the willow!”, “yeah she said so herself she lied!” “Tie her up and let’s take her back!”
“You will do nothing of the sort Mr. Bluelamp!”, commanded Orvin, “For someone named after a light you’re a slightly dim bulb.” Bluelamp gave a grunt. “By my socks, my pants, and my hat I stand before you to swear that this girl is true, and since blue is the color of true, in some way or form this girl must be blue too!”
“ha ha” laughed Mr. Bluelamp in a very mean way. “You stand and say that I’m the dim bulb old man, but tell us, how do you know she is true? Were you with her at the willow? Did you see this strange lady? Tell us Orvin, how credible is your source?”
“Yeah!” Said Mrs. Bluepail as her daughter began to wail. ”Mommy did she really kill the willow?” She asked through her tears. 
“You may believe she’s true Orvin.” Said Mrs. Bluepot, “but we do not!” The entire Bluehair family stared a very mean stare. Then all of the Bluesprouts started to shout. “Kick Her Out! Kick Her Out!
“Wait!” bellowed Mrs. Bluesocks. “You will do no such thing! If anyone so much as touches a hair on her head they’ll never eat one of my pies again.”
Everyone took pause and began to calm down, when Mrs. Bluegown, the only other pie maker in town, shouted out, “You fed those pies to a liar.” 
Madelyn tried to explain, to find a way to make them see that she had done nothing wrong, but her words weren’t being heard as the whole town started to shout, “Lie Pies!” and “Kick Her Out!”
Orvin turned to Madelyn in shock. There was not a convincing thing he could say to sway the people’s thinkers. “Run,” he said to Madelyn under his breath, “Run to the lake! As quick as you get!” 
Madelyn plunged through the crowd and down to the edge of the lake to gaze in its waters. The crowd was yelling loudly, and she thought she heard footsteps stepping behind, but they stopped in their step at what happened next.
The blue started to drain from the lake! Madelyn stared as the blue slid from the shores like a blanket being pulled in the middle. Only not from the middle, not the middle at all! Can you imagine the look on Madelyn’s face when she saw she was the puller! The blue slunk to where she sat, too afraid to look back to see how the people would react. When the last bit of blue had drained from the lake Madelyn gazed, praying to see a reflection of blue. But black was all she could see. The moon had already made its round. And now, without the light of the lake, she could barely see her own face.
She spun around to the crowd to see morning beginning her ride behind the angry people. She closed her peepers as tight as she could as they approached. An old woman accused “You destroyed our lake. You’ve forsaken all we know to be true. Do you not have even the courage to look us in the eyes?”
Some thoughts in Madelyn’s thinker suddenly seemed clearer as the crowd got nearer. Behind closed eyes, Madelyn realized what became of the blue in the lake.
“My eyes are now as blind as yours,” She said in a stronger voice than before. “but even blind, I can tell false from true and so should you be able to. You want to see my eyes? You want proof my claim about the willow is true? Fine!” She cried out just as the sun reached her nose. “Here you go!” and Madelyn opened her eyes.
Imagine if you were to cover the bottom of the most beautiful blue lagoon with diamonds freshly shined. And imagine each diamond reflected a bright blue sky. If you can imagine all that, you’re imaginings combined would just about be the color of Madelyn’s eyes.
“Is that enough proof?” She demanded, “Can everyone now see the blue in me? Does anyone doubt my honesty?” There was no murmuring in the crowd now. “Well guess what…? I lied! Madelyn surprised the crowd. “I told you this whole time that I didn’t have any blue and as it turns out, that wasn’t true.” Then in a wonderful hurry, Madelyn remembered the third thing she’d heard from the blue lady. So she looked behind the people to the mountain in the morning light and gasped. “If you still doubt me,” She smiled, “Look at the mountain.” As they turned, for the first time anyone could think, the town of Loch Blue saw the true greens peak.

There were plenty of sorrys that morning. Plenty of stuttering and stammering, professed with distress ‘we would never have sent you back where you began’-ings. But finally Orvin escorted her to the edge of town where there were not so many blues around. 
“I say Madelyn! You have certainly turned and churned the blue people’s world.” Said Orvin as he grinned, “About time too! Finally the truth of true blue!” His smile widened as he winked. “Where will you go now my dear? I can offer something from my travel guide ‘A Collection of Direction Suggestions to bring to your Attention’. Section 1 perhaps? ‘From talking drops to Rumirocks; The Clocks, Docks, and Shops to Stop and See While Walking along Greens Peak Creek.”
“Oh that all sounds lovely Orvin, but first I need to find my friend Glenn again. Do you remember which way he went? I’m sure he’d love to hear your talk on Rumirocks and whatnot as well, Mr. Bluesocks.”
He stopped, and Madelyn learned how stern he can be. “Madelyn, I thought I made it clear to you that Glenn is no friend. Glenn Bend will never be welcome in Loch Blue again. Not here! Not now! Not then!”
“But surely now that we know the truth about blue, Glenn can come here too.”
Orvin sighed and looked to where the sunlight lay on the lake “My Anna used to stand in the sun and gaze in the lake. She was always a dreamer and as dreamers do she sought out the only other dreamer she knew. She was six years and ten when she met Glenn. He was a cheat and a thief even back then. He stole her heart Madelyn, and he sold it to the willow. When she went to get it back, the trip was the last she’d ever take in Loch Blue.”
“I came back to the place in the blue grass where I first saw her face, but the woman I saw was filled with rage. Fire burned in her eyes as she was cast out to where she’d begun with no memory of a family, or a home, or love. I don’t know what it was the willow had done, but because of Glenn our precious beauty was gone.”
“Madelyn please, come with me and I’ll take you along Green’s Peak Creek, up the meadow to the canyon where the walls become steep. I’ll guide you through the crossing and over. From there you can restart your quest for The Garden. If you go back to him you’ll have to take the long way round, a way where more have been lost than found.”
Madelyn smiled in a sad sort of way, “Then this is goodbye for awhile Orvin, I do hope I’ll see you again soon.” 
He’s stare become sterner than ever. At least one second it was there, but by the next one it was soft and loving and full of care. “Goodbye Madelyn Blue-Eyes. I hope you do too.”
She gave him a hug and began to run, to return to the place she’d begun. She was worried for her friend. As she ran, she gave one last glance to see Mr. Bluesocks with his blue hat and blue pants pick a spot to sit and lean on a tree, waiting for the day that Madelyn would return. 
Loch Blue had long disappeared from view when Madelyn crossed the crest of a crumbling hill to see her friend Glenn bent down on his knees staring right down at the ground. Madelyn could see now something she couldn’t before. Right there behind Glenn was a furry little friend just waiting for him to turn and learn the truth about the shadow of a germlan.
Madelyn walked down to stand in front of Glens head. She placed her toes two feet in front of his nose, snapped her heels together and said, “Glen you silly man, pick yourself up, turn around, and face your germlan. I can guarantee there will be no Glenn on the menu today!”
“Is that you Madelyn?” Glenn asked. “I’m sorry, I can’t. I’ve dragged it’s shadow for so long there’s no telling the size of the ferocious beast behind lurking behind me.” Glenn Said “It’s been followed me since the last time I saw her, the day she went away.”
A new thought passed through Madelyn’s thinker, about how heavy the shadow of her germlan had been.  Madelyn bent down as low to the ground as she could and leaned over till she was almost the wrong side around. 
“Look in my eyes and tell me that the famous Glenn Bend can’t find the strength it takes to face the fearsome fellow that follows him because frankly, I don’t buy it!” 
As Madelyn peeped across at his eyes she saw for the first time two tiny specks of blue. She thought they might be reflections of her own, when slowly, the same as the lake, as if the brown that his eyes were draped in was pulled aside to reveal the most beautiful, blue eyes!
 So blue she would have sworn it was nothing more than a reflection of her own, the same reflection she saw in Mr. Blue, but she knew that was not the truth. The truth was that for the first time in a very long while, there was blue in the smiling eyes of Glenn Bend.
There was a life in his eyes that wasn’t before, like he’d been let loose from a cage and sent out to explore the world and its ways. A tear or two welled up in the blue and slowly rolled its way down his cheek as his smile got wider. “If I’m not mistaken, there’s a small furry fellow who’s been following me longer than I know.” He whispered with a wink Madelyn nodded her head with a smile.
The germlan was staring wide eyed listening the whole time. He bounced about a bit excited for the surprise he’s waited years to find. As Glenn turned his head the germlan abruptly saluted with a smile. Now he wiggled back and forth quite a lot. It had been so many years since he had made someone smile. Watching him bounce with pride, Madelyn couldn’t stop the jiggly feels from inside. The jiggles turned to giggles and then to flat out laughs. She saw Glenn and Herblan laughing back which sent her laughing all the harder, and that was that for a few moments more.
“Madelyn, this is Herblan, my germlan.” Glenn smiled “he’s named after a flower that grows near Germlan pond on the other side of green’s peak. Orvin once told me the pond has waves and that although some people say it’s the moon that pulls its waters to and fro, the truth is it’s the heart of a lonely Germlan looking for her love that beats the surf on the sand. It’s said that the colors on a herblan flower clash and clang so loud that travelers can hear them from the top of Green Peak calling to the lost that they should come back home.”
“I can’t believe I forgot my old friend,” Glenn said as Herblan hopped on his shoulder. “Herblan, Orvin, and I had quite the time researching the workings of Germlan families.”
Glenn picked himself up and sat with his arms round his knees. Madelyn couldn’t understand how the eye color of a man could possibly be so powerful. But, the Glenn sitting in front of her was not the same man as when they began. With just two little moves of his blue eyes, one to her and the other to the log by his side, Glenn made Madelyn feel home again. She sat and he scootched closer, put his arm round her shoulder, and they sat in a silence so warm and wonderful, Madelyn tried to decide if it was the best silence of her life. She grew up in a town where shout equals out. She has heard her share of silences. It was something she knew quite a lot about. Once it was time, she decided indeed, to end the best silence of her life. A question burning inside her was getting much hotter, maybe if she had a glass of water, but as it was she just had to let it out. She heard her own words shatter the best silence ever. 
“What really happened to you and Anna?”
Chapter
“I like to think the last time I saw Anna was in loch blue. I like to believe that when I got my Germlan years ago the thing that distracted me from what lay behind was not her. That woman raged and roared about her heart and that devilish brooch as she ran back to Redfield’s creek to search for her Garden there. 
He stared into the trees as if it was she, not pillars of wood and leaves he was seeing. “She was so beautiful. Madelyn you should have seen her before, before all those fiery years on that shore. She was a dreamer, and she had a make believer so powerful we would sit by the lake for hours, staring at the clouds believing in dreams.  And we did, we dreamt of journeying to the garden, what we would find there, and whether the weather would be wintery or warm or fair along the way.
I’m not mad at her. She got confused. She mis-believed that her destiny was a destination, not a journey.  I played along pretending my deepest desire was to find the garden, but fact is, it wasn’t. You see it never really mattered to me if we found it. I would more happily be dreaming with her at that lake than at the gates of any other place, no matter how much placeness it may or may not have. If finding this place, this Garden, means you must erase your dreams from the sky, then it is a place I’ll have no part in.”
Madelyn didn’t know why, but a scary feel rose up from inside. Glenn must have noticed because he quickly smiled and said “I’ll have no part in it, because my part is out here, helping silly little girls in silly little skirts on their journey to the destination of their destiny” he said as his grin widened to a smile “wherever that may be”. 
“Now little one, tell me what have you done while you were away?” Glenn asked. “Your gray eyes were the most beautiful I’ve peeped in my life. But unless mine are misaligned, they’re as beautiful as I knew, but they now appear to be quite blue.”
“We were so you young back then. It started on her blue day. It was the first time in how long no one could say that 2 people of loch blue had been chosen by the willow to stay, not because of blue socks or blue shoes or blue ties, which neither of us had, but for the blue in their eyes.”
It was a wonderful celebration. Especially Mrs. Bluesocks three tree pies. She used fruit from three different trees in each. I remember she was gone for 4 whole days so she could pick a fruit from 99 trees to make 33 three tree pies not one of them the same, Orvin gave each of us a tin he promised to fill with delicious treats every now and again. Then he gave Anna a tiny pouch not much bigger than your hand with a rolled up piece of paper and a brooch. I can still recall, word for word, what I heard when she read the note aloud”
My dear daughter — There’s nothing I can say to portray the angst it brings me to write these words, for if you haven’t heard them from my mouth instead, you must be six years and ten and that’s a long while to go without knowing your dad. 
Your mother has left for the garden and I must go find her. If I walk with the sun and the moon I expect to be back in thirty three rounds. If that should not be the case, be brave and know I leave you with a man I trust to bring you great care. He will guide you and help you prepare to search for a Garden of your own one day.
I have no words to explain or make it ok. I don’t even have a word for your name. Your mother would name you Bella, for the beauty you’ll be, but I saw bright stars in the sky smile tonight when they saw you were alive. A heavenly celebration rang out from the sky and Anna was my reply. It was the most beautiful word I’ve heard in my whole life and, since you are reading a note that was not supposed to be needed, for the past sixteen years it’s the only word I’ve heard.
The brooch was your mothers. When she broke it I offered to buy her another. Who wants to pin a broken heart to their chest? I asked. She told me they were just two parts of the same heart and she would accept no other. I leave both parts for you my dear for wherever this brooch goes, our hearts are following close behind 
I don’t think she ever gazed at the lake again, she’d stare instead at a broken brooch and read those rolled up words. We didn’t talk about the smells or the colors of The Garden anymore. Our dreamings became schemings and her eyes reflected that fiery red as she stared and shouted ‘we have to get started!’ until one day all that was left was one tiny spec of blue in her eyes. She came to me and she told me her heart was too heavy to bare. She gave it to me for safe keeping and care. 
2 parts of a heart is a lot to bare for a girl with as heavy a heart as she. A heart that had fared just fine on its own before that broken brooch came along. We had to do something soon while that shred of blue still survived. There was more at stake then just Anna and my fate. The rules in Loch Blue are perfectly clear…”
“Actually, they’ve changed a bit.” Madelyn smiled
“Excuse me?” Glenn replied, “Is there something I ought to know?”
“I met the willow and I broke the rules of loch blue, and I didn’t mean it to, but the willow crumbled in front of me. I met a lady made of water and she told me what I ought to say to save the town, but that’s a whole other story. Please. Will you keep going?”
Glenn seemed to think it over before he spoke “I unpinned it from her chest, placed it in my vest and took it to the willow to see if she could erase it from her memory and bring back the make believing dreamer from before. It hung in the air as the wind through the leaves and reeds whispered her answer. 
“We could help him” It whispered from near. “We could not” it whispered from far. “We must be careful” it whispered to my right. On my left it said “Yes, the fate of three hearts are at stake.” From up ahead “He probably stole it” from behind “Yes how can we know you own it?” 
“I don’t own it exactly” 
“I told you. It’s not his to give away” the whisper interrupted 
“But the woman I love gave it to me to give to you to see what you could do to help. She’s losing her blue you see. I’m sorry to say I don’t know how long she can continue this way.” 
“How do we know he’s not lying?”
“Because my eyes are blue. You said yourself that meant I was true.”
“What he speaks is the truth” “It might be, but a heavy heart is not something to handle lightly.” “Maybe not a lie, but what if it is a great misunderstanding.”
“Very well” it whispered from all around “we will take it, but before we do anything more we will need proof this is what your love intended to do. If we gave her a choice between this burning red heart and your bright blue eyes, which do you think she would she choose?”
“I’m certain she’d choose me. She already has.” 
“Then certainly you wouldn’t mind if we ran a little test. A simple one to clear up any misunderstandings.”
“Very well, what do I have to do?” 
“We just need to borrow the blue from your eyes for a bit. When Anna arrives we will let her decide between you and the broach. Once she chooses you, as you’re sure she’ll do, we’ll return your blue to you and, take the broach, and happily remove the fire from her eyes.”
“I accept”
“Consider your choice closely. You do know what happens when you lose your blue?”
“Of course. I will be back where I began with no memory of Loch Blue. I don’t care. It doesn’t matter anyways. As long as you remove the heart from memory, and get rid of the fire in her eyes.”
“Accepted. Normally you would forget all the years between now and when you began. But we are a romantic and because of your love we’ll only take two.”
“I understand. It doesn’t matter anyways. Now do what you have to do.”
She said she would take it, but as payment she needed the blue in my eyes as trust that when given the choice Anna would choose my blue over the brooch’s red.”
There was no price I wouldn’t pay to have them back. So I agreed to her fee. I paid and watched the blue of my eyes drain to the water. Suddenly, I was snapped through the sky and the water changed into a strange new creek, the one you see here I think.
“I’ve heard told” he smiled and winked at Madelyn “That I sold it for pleasure, and wealth, and stardom, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. I was trying to buy them back. The pleasure we had dreaming and designing from clouds in the sky, the wealth of the world we had created together, and stardom, the true stardom that comes from celebrating with the heavens that something so beautiful is alive and next to you in this world. 
“I was looking for a way back, and crack! Anna was standing in front of me smoldering with ashy eyes. She seemed surprised to see me and she told me that the deal I had done had destroyed the heart of a mother and father as well as her own. I tried to follow as she ran, but that’s when I discovered our furry friend. By the time I caught up she was waiting at the top of the and one inch cliff. She walked down the path to where the river made it’s first bend back and told me I must never round that bend to follow her again.”
I think it would be best if we stayed here for the night” He said as if he had snapped out of a dream. “we can eat, catch some sleep, and rest for our trek in the morning”
Madelyn agreed, but when she lay down in Herblan’s shadow, she couldn’t seem to shut her peepers. Green mountain creek and the garden were nearer than ever before.  She thought she might never fall asleep with all of the astounding surroundings, when all of a sudden she woke to see Herblan smiling beside her. Together with Glenn, they waved and gave morning the last of their bads. 
Chapter
It’s a well-known fact among pie deliverers that the weight of an 8 pound tray of three tree pies seems a burlier burden to bare than a load of three or four. To the man bearing the burden with his bare hands the change would be grand, but what’s the difference of four or five to the horse pulling the bulging, bulk of pies? 
After the duration of deliveries however, the horse’s sensation of elation at the lack of weight on his back will be grand. The slightest motivation and he’ll follow the temptation to return to his destination, the pie station. Eventually a series of rearings and mis-steerings in these situations has led to the wise words of the pie guys — A heavy-handed, handling of a horse after you lighten the nighttime load will leave you with pie on your face. 
Words to the wise from pie guys and pastry peddlers -
Glenn seemed to bounce and bound his way up and down the path. Although one of his bounds was a bit too bouncy. He nearly nicked his nose on a limb! But soon enough he was back again, walking with Madelyn. Herblan the germlan sat on her shoulder, smiling as the sun got warmer. 
Even though Greens peak was nearer than ever before, it was still very far from near. It’s sheer steepness and giant peaks made Madelyn think the trip up would be twice as hard as any other trip that far. If that was where she could find the Garden though, then no peak, pinnacle, or summit was enough to keep her from it. Her determination to reach their destination however, didn’t much help the feel of fear and exhaustion that swelled in her insides. A concoction of feels, it seemed, was not shared by Glen Bend as he pranced down the path like a soon to be muddy puppy fresh from a bath.
“How can you bound about when you know that we’re going to a place where more are lost than found?” She announced, astounded by his eager cheer.
“Because I know something you don’t” He gloated. “The valley below is the home of the pie guys!” Just as Glenn finished the sentence a roaring cart went soaring by them on the path. The driver just waved and laughed as it clunked and clashed across the tall grass of the valley below. Then, all of a sudden, Glenn waved back and started running. Not knowing what else to do Madelyn grabbed Herblan and ran too. To or from, who or what they were running, she hadn’t a clue. Until at last she saw the pie guy who had been driving the cart practically tackle Glenn with a hug that quite honestly, looked like it hurt. 
She saw Glenn lean in and whisper something in the stranger’s ear. Whatever word was whispered and heard the look the pie guy gave her was very bizarre, like he was seeing an old friend from afar. Behind him, was a caravan of pie carts as far as her peepers could peep. One after another they waited in line to refill their pies and set off on the night’s ride. When she got closer the stranger took Madelyn’s hand in both of his and shook them all.
“What an honor it is to meet you,” he said, “Name’s Zebulon Pie, but just Zeb for people I like,” He said. “And of course their friends” He added, “I’m the head of the delicious tarts and treats delivery department for Bluesock’s Incorporated.”
“I never knew the Bluesock’s had stock in a pie business.” Madelyn Replied.
Zeb smiled “I wouldn’t say THEY do. It’s Mrs. Bluesocks that runs the operations while the old guy practices his recitations on whatever poor fellow gets near enough to hear. Pies delivered from Greens Peak to Redfield and every bend on the river between is our motto, and as you know that’s a whole lot of pies.”
“Madelyn,” Glenn interrupted “Why don’t you pick a pie at the pie stand and give me a moment with my dear friend Zeb here.”
“The sugared spruce and buttered birch are great this time of year.” Zeb called as she walked down the hill to the cart. “I’d steer clear of the pickled hickory if I were you though.”
Madelyn watched in wonder as a hundred or more pie guys loaded their carts with confections and directions to where they were going. Some of them held pies stacked so high Madelyn feared the towering tins would topple at any moment, but she was surely wrong. Granted, there were some weebles and wobbles, but not a single topple. They loaded every pie imaginable from smoked oak to pine surprise behind their horse, as the remarkable animals balanced the load ready to pull the bulking mass on their nightly rounds.  
Madelyn found a maple cherry that looked quite good, and turned back towards Glenn and Zeb. She saw Glenn hurriedly take paper and pen and draw out some sort of message or map. He handed it back, and with that, Zeb un-hitched his horse and galloped into the forest. Of course, as soon as Madelyn reached Glenn she asked where Zeb went. 
“He went to deliver something to a friend” Glenn said.
“What?” Madelyn asked a little brashly.
He knelt down and their blue eyes locked. “You’re a girl with a lot of curiosity,” He smiled, “but I think, for now, secrecy is what we need. One thing should not be secret though.” He tapped his finger on her nose and said, “I want you to know that I love you, you silly little girl. I’m proud to call you a friend and wherever we may be, I’ll always be there to get you where you need to go to find your home.” 
“Even to a place with no placeness?” She asked excitedly. “Even there.” He replied, and after a short picnic of pies the trio returned to their journey.
When they returned to the path and at last were back on track for The Garden, Glenn stepped in front of her and knelt down a bit.
“Madelyn, I’m not going to lie,” He said, “There is a reason why they say that more who come this way are lost than found. There’s only one route in or out. There’s only one way up, and a thousand down. Mind your steps, keep an eye on what’s coming next, and we’ll be OK. This is not like Blind Man’s Creek. A fall will leave you much worse than lost with a scuffed up knee.”

# 2 The mis-pronunciation of “missing steps”
The 7 leading theories of eerie disappearings in the forests and clearings around Green’s Peak
The trio arrived at the Misty Steps. They stood, staring up to a stairway that steered steeply into the clouds above. The rolling thunder shaking the ground under the cloud made Madelyn wonder if she should go back and talk Mr. Bluesocks into letting Glenn back in. But her wondering was over when Glenn held her hand in his and said, “Hold on tight, silly girl. There’s bound to be some whisps and wooshes up there, but we’ll get through it together.” So, with friends at her side, more determined than ever before, Madelyn took a sturdy stride and stepped on the set of the misty stairs that led to the clouds.  
Now, I think you’d agree that any staircase that reaches a cloud is quite an astounding set of escalations, but imagine Madelyn’s surprise when she found out the misty steps were not just a flight of stairs! They were, in fact, also stairs of flight. A strange thing happened as Madelyn started to climb. She seemed to get lighter. And the higher she went, the lighter she seemed to get!  
The clouds surrounded so thickly that she couldn’t peep the shoes on her feet. A strange thing happened then, at first she thought someone had lightened her pack. Then the straps went slack, and she felt it float up her back, past her hair, and up into the air. She pulled it back down,  and started to bounce and bound her way up the staircase. 
She was soaring up the steps, when Glenn called out a warning, “Madelyn! You mustn’t…”, was all she heard before the clouds separated him from her. She was wondering why he’d make such a fuss as she was on the way up, but on the way down she found out. A sudden breeze cleared a hole to peep where the next step was. Unfortunately, from what she peeped, the next step… wasn’t. A very large gap was all that lay between her and a very big splat.
She began plummeting down wondering how long it would be before the ground came round, but suddenly the straps on her back snapped tight. A very, very happy feel fell over Madelyn as Glenn used her bag to reel her back on the step again.
“Are you out of your mind child?” Glenn scolded coldly, “I told you not to bounce around this high up from the ground, and what do you do? I swear…” But his swearing went unsworn as Madelyn made the shortest of hops to throw her arms around Glenn’s shoulders. “Thank You! Thank You! And Thank You again.” Madelyn said.
Glenn seemed to get just a bit warmer, and Madelyn swore she saw a smile hiding in the corner of his mouth. “Why are you smiling? I almost fell all the way from the ground. If you hadn’t grabbed my pack… splat.” Madelyn flattened one hand in her other to demonstrate the effect.
“You are a silly little girl in a silly little skirt.”
“I know, I know I’m so sorry…”
“Don’t”, said Glenn, "apologize. You are a silly little girl in a silly little skirt, and that’s what you’re supposed to be. Take another look at your bag.” Madelyn glanced and saw a long piece of rope, it wrapped around and, on the other end, was bound to Glenn. “Honestly, what kind of Bend would I have been if my promise to take you to The Garden hadn’t gotten any farther than a bounce and a bound and you on the ground by a very tall cliff?”
“I saw your steps getting lighter and told you it might be smart to tie ourselves together, but I don’t think you heard.” 
“How did you tie the rope to my back? “
“I had to huck a Germlen at you.” He smiled and winked at Herblan who smiled proudly back and jumped out using the rope that was tied round his middle to swing around and around at Glenn’s side. His smile seemed to widen every time he flew by.
“Although, you might find it’s useful to listen to what I say every once in a while.“ He smiled.
As they slowly stepped their way above the gray clouds, Madelyn asked aloud “What did you write on the note you gave Zeb?” 
“Still curios about that?” asked Glenn. “It was a note to an old friend.”
“Which friend?” Asked Madelyn, louder than she’d liked.
“Nope, that’s all you get for now.”
Suddenly the steps they’d been walking had turn into sloppy wet ground so thick Madelyn wished she had boots. Glenn was walking ahead so with slurp and a burp Madelyn trudged through the muck to catch up.
“What do you mean all I get for now? Are you going to tell me more later?” 
Madelyn, I have a secret for you. Glenn said bending down. It’s a wonderful, happy secret, but there’s a special way you need to hear it. That’s what the note is about, and that’s all I can tell you for now.” Hard as she tried she couldn’t get Glenn to tell her more. Finally, she fell in line behind Glenn hopping from spot to spot where he’s boot’s had been and wondered how wet one could get.
Madelyn felt the chilly drizzle seep in her socks as she took another squishy step all too aware of the dizzying heights to her left and right. When, there in the misty morning light, she saw a stranger sight than you can guess. There, where the path wrapped back around the mountain below, floating in the middle of the abyss of the canyon below was a very large circle of stone. 
The thing was no further than a few hundred steps away, but in between was a very large cliff. It was not quite the height of the —- and one inch cliff. In fact when Madelyn looked down she found it to be not that tall at all. 
“Look Glenn. There’s something next to that bridge below the cliff.”
Glenn walked to edge of the cliff beside Madelyn and peered down. “There I see it. I wonder what it is. Only one way to know, but we should eat before we start down.” Glenn said.
“I don’t want to eat now. We can eat once we’re down. It’s not that tall. We should be there in no time at all.”
“Suit yourself” Said Glenn, grabbing a snack for Herblan and him from his bag. In between chews he told Madelyn one of the most useful truths to ever be told.
If you open your ears as wide as you can, I’ll share this truth with you as well. The distance between the place that you seek and where you stand on your feet, will always be no more or less than one single step. Glenn had more to say about that.  
“Don’t make too many decisions on distances measured from above.” He told her, “The farthest places can often appear, far before expected. While what’s near may seem close when you expect it the most, it’s often farther than you bargained.”
Madelyn was trying to decide if Glenn had drank the same sap as the tree who told her she didn’t know what she knew. She decided to take a step and see. Before too many more they came again to the abrupt end in the path. Glenn grabbed his rope and tied it round her middle.
A funny thing happened as Glenn lowered her down the next ledge. Madelyn started to get what he said. Here they were, near enough to throw a rock and hit the bridge, but here was so high it might be nighttime before they got down. As she lay dangling back and forth, hanging by her middle, Madelyn couldn’t agree more that getting to the bridge was much more than she’d bargained for. She thought they’d be done by lunch, but they barely made dusk.
“Look Glenn!” Madelyn called back, “It’s a head. Hurry up, look!” She pointed to the head ahead of them.
“Shhh!” Glen shushed, “heads have ears and if this head can hear perhaps it would be better if we kept quiet so it can continue to rest. With a noggin that size, one nod and we’d all be squashed. I think it would be best not to wake it from its nap.”
With that, they slowly approached the giant head of stone, but as they got nearer they found there was nothing to fear, for the head was attached to a body that stood, if you can believe it, on the ground down below on the canyon’s floor. It was a statue the size of which you’re likely never to find. Would you believe it was taller than the tallest tree you’ve ever seen… with another on top… and five just like it stacked between.
It was quite clearly just stone though. It didn’t flinch, or wince, or react at all to the rock Madelyn had just thrown. “Madelyn!” Glenn reprimanded, “It’s not polite to throw rocks at statues to find out if they’re alive. You very well could have hit him in the eye.”
“He didn’t seem to mind,” She smiled. “Look at that.” Madelyn said as he pointed ahead. The path seemed to vanish into the vast unseen of the canyon below not 300 steps from where they stood now. It was as if the canyon had swerved and its curve had carved away part of the massive mountain. Unfortunately, for Herblan, Madelyn, and Glenn, it was the part the path was on. As the light swept farther across the land Madelyn saw something she hadn’t before. Behind the statue of stone hung a tiny little bridge made of wood and rope. On the statue’s back was a plaque that read: IT is a rope bridge 
It was indeed, so they crossed behind the moss covered side of the statue of stone. At the end of the bridge was a sign welcoming them to the land of the Rumirocks. As they walked along in the Rumirock’s home the canyon’s curvy carvings cut across the path and back time and again, but each time round they found a Rumirock standing with its back to a bridge and on it a plaque to explain which kind of bridge it is.
The next it seemed was made of wooden logs. The back of the Rumirock that stood beside described, IT is a beam bridge, and so it went that every time the path fell to the canyon below there was a helpful stone fellow who’d built a bridge to cross. Pretty soon IT was a girder, a trestle, and a truss. It was a ridged one once and a roving the next. Then a segmented, suspension with a stone step that seemed to Madelyn to lean a bit to the left. 
The next they came to had the most beautiful arch that Madelyn had ever looked through. Though I must tell you, Madelyn hadn’t been able to look into more than a handful or two. The difference between those handfuls and the one she was standing on was that they covered the way to get from one place to another, while this particular arch was over a bridge that went to nowhere. It looked as though someone had abandoned the bridge and left it half built for as Madelyn stared at the air where the bridge should have continued it was missing the statue on whose back you could read what it was. She might have been more concerned but she could spy in the distance another bridge where the path curved back to the right. 
“Come on silly little girl,” Glenn smiled as he walked ahead. “There’s a better bridge up there I’ll bet.”
But Glenn bet wrong. The next bridge was brilliantly beautiful with golden gilded girders that glistened in the sun, but this bridge too was far from done. As they paced up the path they passed bridge after bridge not a one of which spanned the canyon to the land beyond. 
As the suns last rays sank for the day, the trio of weary travelers came upon the first Rumirock they’d seen in a while. At last they’d found the statue who’d built their way across they thought, but Madelyn was at a loss for words when she saw that the bridge that ought to have been at its back was not. The path passed into dark depths ahead. Without a bridge to assist, they were stuck on this side with no way of traveling further in sight. 
Amidst grumblings and groanings, Glenn decided they would rest for the night and resume their roaming in the morning. He picked up a rock that was in the spot he wanted to sleep and with an absent minded toss he threw the rock at the statue staring to where the bridge should be. He picked up another, “Fat lot of good that fellow is.” He said as he sent it whizzing through the air where it struck the statue on the side of its face.
A giant face, that until now had been as still as a statue, frowned. 
It glared down at Glenn and in a voice deeper than the depths of the canyon below it bellowed “Don’t you know It’s not polite to throw rocks at statues in the night? You very well could have hit me in the eye.”
“Madelyn” Glenn whispered as he grabbed her pack and slowly stepped back from the statue ahead. “I’ll distract him while you and Herblan run back to safety.”
“Or maybe,” She said, “he’s just cross because you tossed a rock at his head. Why don’t you try apologizing instead? It’s not polite to throw rocks after all.” 
Glenn looked down to see if she was serious and must have decided so. “I apologize.” Glenn stammered, “I didn’t think you were alive.” The rumirock seemed less than impressed with Glenn’s half way confession. 
Madelyn shook her head, stepped in front of Glenn and said, “What my friend means is he’s sorry he hit you with a stone. Had he known you were alive he would never have done so, but he hardly thought it likely that a statue with stony eyes like yours could be blinded by a rock.”
“Of course not,” said the Rumirock. “but as introductions go, it’s a fairly unsightly way to say hello.”
“Perhaps we can try again,” Madelyn addressed him, “I am Madelyn, this little guy on my shoulder is Herblan the Germlan, and the pesky, pebble pitcher to my left is named Glenn.” She said as she winked at Glenn.
“I am Groggle. Groggle the Rumirock, the last of my kind.”
“The last?” Madelyn Gasped, “That’s so sad.” 
“Yes, when I pass it shall be the end of the Rumirock line. The heritage that began with the greatest of all great, great, great, great grandpas and the rope bridge you crossed to enter this land. All the way down to my father who created the segmented, suspension with a stone step bridge you stepped across to arrive at this point in the path. This however, is the last of the zigs and zags the canyon has, and once I’ve completed my masterpiece any traveler will be able to pass through these lands with ease. It is the destiny of the stony men, you see.”
“That’s wonderful news!” Madelyn exclaimed, “When do you estimate your bridge will be made? We’re quite eager to be on our way.”
“It shouldn’t take long.” Groggle replied, “I’ve had lots of practice with the samples I’ve designed in the past. Once I decide what it is, this bridge can be built in a night. Why don’t you rest here and I’ll have the bridge built by morning.”
And so, before long at all Madelyn could hear the sawing and squeaking of Glenn and Herblan’s snoring and the grind of stone as Groggle, the last of the Rumirocks set about the task of building a bridge to span the canyon. Madelyn could have sworn she’d just shut her eyes, when to her surprise she woke up to morning. She gave a quick wave and turned to face the new way across the canyon. All she faced however, were three partial starts to bridges that couldn’t get you across if you lined them all up together.
Groggle was ahead by the third. He proudly proclaimed that this was a great day for he had thought up the designs for the greatest bridge of his time, the bridge fated to be the final legacy of the Rumirocks. He just hadn’t gotten to making it yet.
“Of course I had to try a few things first.” He said, “I created a new apparatus with stronger brackets to make  sure the structure will function as a sturdy junction…,” Madelyn was listening as best she could, but she began to feel a bit dizzy “…but then I realized, it may need to be crossed at night sometimes. It seems you’d need a beacon to guide your way in the dark, and for a beacon you’d clearly need an arch. I had to start again to get it right. And right after I started, I realized a tri-trussled design was the only one that would be right for a bridge of this size. I can’t believe I didn’t see it before. I’ve been thinking my whole life about the bridge I’d leave behind, and last night I found the inspiration to create the perfect bridge to say goodbye!”
“That’s great!” said Madelyn. Though she wasn’t quite sure it was. “When do you expect your perfect bridge will be built?”
“There’s no way to say to be sure. Surely not more than a year or less than ten days.” Replied Groggle. “You mustn’t rush such delicate construction.”
Madelyn had had enough of Groggle’s technical talk. She wanted to get on with finding the Garden and there was no way she was going to stay for a year for a bridge to get her from here to there. She knew it was not the nicest thing to say, but the words slipped out anyway.
“I’m not convinced that Groggle the Rumirock the last of his kind even knows how to build a bridge!” She said and quickly wished she hadn’t. She instantly regretted the hurt she saw on Groggle’s face. 
“How can you say what you said?” Groggle asked, taken aback by the cruel comment. “I’ve built astounding arches and golden gilded girders! I won’t stand around and hear some little girl say I can’t build a bridge when you can plainly see the quality in my craft all the way back to where my dad stands proudly on the ground!” 
“Oh yes,” Madelyn continued, for it had to be said, and if not her, who else would be so kindly cruel and point out the obvious truth that stood between Groggle and the bridge of his dreams. 
“You’re right,” She sighed, “You’ve built stunning structures of metal, stone, and wood. Arches that are far more appealing than any I’ve seen. And I have no doubt that the beacon you’re building to light the way across a future bridge someday will be brilliant as well. It is no doubt some of the finest craftsmanship around, but IT is not a bridge until IT is finished and possible to cross. You have built many things Groggle, but a bridge you have not.”
Groggle seemed to sway to the side and Madelyn feared he may topple to the ground below. He placed a massive hand on the canyon wall to brace himself as he knelt down and cried. “I’m the last of my kind.” He pleaded from his knees. “Once a bridge is crossed, once every step between this side and that has been stepped. We are turned into the hardest stone known with a sign on our back with the name of our bridge. Our bridges and our statues will live on forever, but once my bridge is crossed there will never be another built by a rumirock
“Can you imagine what it’s like to know that a legacy stretching centuries in the past will pass with me? I think if you did you would not be so quick to spit words of hurt just so a silly little girl in a silly little skirt can step across and be on her merry way.”
“Hey!” Glenn roared from behind, “I’m the only one who calls her that! And she’s simply stating the fact that it seems there is nothing amongst your constructions that can function as a proper crossing. Sorry big guy. She’s being honest, not mean.” 
“It does not matter,” The ground quaked as Groggle stood and made his way to stare face to face at Madelyn and Glenn. A day or year or a thousand more, they’re all the same to me I’m afraid. My masterpiece will never be built. I’m a failure to the Rumirock guild.”
“Here,” he said as he strung two giant ropes across the canyon. “If you stand on the one down here and use your hands to grab onto the one above you can shimmy your way across. It’s a poor excuse for a bridge, I know. It will fray and sway and sag in the middle, and I will stand next to it forever with a plaque on my back that says IT is a failure. I’ve tried for more years than I can count and frankly it’s worn me down and tired me out. I don’t care anymore. You have your way across, now please, cross and be on your way.”
Madelyn glanced down at Herblan as tears welled up in his oversized eyes. They seemed to plead with her to help the earthen mass trying to grasp that his life’s work might be for not. Herblan gave a sorry little blink as a thought popped into Madelyn’s thinker.  
“It is not a failure. And neither are you.” Madelyn said with as much gusto as she could muster. “You are now Groggle the bridge maker and while I thank you for the bridge you just built, I beg you to build another.”
“I already told you I can’t. As you’ve seen and clearly pointed out, the only bridge I’ve built is barely a bridge at all.”
“That may be true,” She replied, “but look around you. You’ve started brilliant and beautiful bridges on the side of the canyon for as far as the eye can see. It seems to me that if you took the partial starts and unfinished parts and put them together you’d probably have a bridge that’s better than any your ancestors could dream of.”
Groggle smiled in a sad kind of way. “You may be right, but what could I possibly name such a thing. I can’t stand next to a bridge for the rest of time with a sign on my back that says It is —blank.” 
“It doesn’t need a name, and you can stand by it for the rest of its days knowing it’s helping travelers along the way. If I wasn’t called Madelyn, if I was a Susan, or a Mary, or a Harriet my friends would like me just the same I bet. If the things I say and do are good and true, it doesn’t matter if I’m Madelyn or Allison, I’ll still be a good friend to have around. Whatever its name, you will build the bridge of the great groggle the rumirock, last of his kind with a bridge no one had thought of before, solidly sound and great for keeping people off the ground.
Groggle grinned, and his giant stone cheeks turned a slight shade of pink. “You might” he said “be right” and that was all. With that he stood up and got back to work.
— end of ‘solid’ storyline — 
Later that night Madelyn woke up to a roaring of snoring. The moon was shining bright in the sky throwing a soft blue glow on the trees below. Madelyn decided to walk up the canyon. The land became lighter as the moon moved overhead. One spot seemed to be lighter than the rest. It was a strange glow, the strangest you’ll ever know. It rose above the trees across the canyon painting them with orange and red. Madelyn walked slower until the glow got closer. 
Suddenly something stepped out from the trees! It was so bright she had to cover her eyes. When she lowered her hand she found the bright spot heading away up the canyon. It wasn’t quite on fire, but it was glowing brightly, flickering and blowing this way and that. Which was quite strange to see when every other flower, twig, and tree was quiet as a mouse and as still as could be.
Madelyn followed it up the canyon which narrowed as they rose, until Madelyn and the glow stopped where both sides were blocked by a solid stone wall. She thought the glow had nowhere to go, but suddenly it vanished into the wall across the canyon. She and Glenn had been here before. In the daylight she was sure it was impassable, but in the moonlight she saw a door, an entrance to a cave covered in cracked wood and blocked by a boulder. With a great heave she pushed the boulder and pulled off the wood blocking the way. She stared into the cave for as the moonlight could reach inside. Big spikes hung from the ceiling and grew from the floor like nothing she’d ever seen before. For just one moment Madelyn paused to decide. She was nervous. She didn’t know if the cave was dangerous or adventurous. Then with a deep breath and a small step she found herself inside. 
The cave was just wide enough for her to walk through. It seemed rather wet. Tiny drops fell from the wall to the floor and flowed their way back to the river and out the door. When she arrived at the line where the moonlight no longer shined she rubbed her peepers to let them adjust, and was pleasantly surprised to find she could see just fine. 
She wondered where the light came from and why it got brighter as she went along. Her wonderings were answered when the little cave grew to a cavern. One that opened to both sides of the canyon. The glow was blinding bright as it lit up the caverns. The cavern closed into a great stone wall, but the little cave kept going. Still the shine from the cavern spilled in the cave was enough to keep lighting Madelyn’s way. 
She continued walking and walking and every so often the cave would open to a bright cavern again. The path ahead started to rise, and as she climbed she noticed the span of the cavern had narrowed. The next cavern brought the sides of the canyon the closest yet. Less than a handful of hops, if she had to guess. Although she could never know for sure because measuring a canyon’s width like this always stops after one hop. When she looked down the canyon the river was a tiny wiggling line. It looked taller than 5 —insert from earlier cliff— one inch cliffs stacked one on another.
The glow was slowly moving up the canyon and Madelyn started to follow again. Another stone wall stood ahead. But this time the glow didn’t continue. It just stayed there instead. Madelyn waited to see what it would do. After awhile she decided it must be waiting too. She stood and walked around and before too long she heard a sound. It sounded like a voice, one she had heard before. She followed it until she found a spot clearly made for sitting. There was a flat stone for her bottom and one for her back. And on either side, one for her arms. The whole thing was covered in spongy green moss. It was near the edge of the canvern next to the towering stone wall. 
No sooner had she sat down than a voice so clear it seemed right next to her ear. 
“Madelyn. It’s me” Said a woman’s voice 
“Me who?” Madelyn replied shading her eyes from the blinding light.
“Oh. Of course.” She said, and no sooner than she did the great glow started to dull. Slowly Madelyn could see the bright light form. It took shape, and the shape was a person. First a torso, then two legs. Two arms, then a head. A head with glowing golden hair flowing over shoulders and down a back. Its skin was swirling with bright reds and deep blues. They swirled. They shimmered they shined. They rippled like water and bristled like fire all at the same time. Tiny blazing waves gave way to swirling flames. Had Madelyn not been lost in it’s beauty, she might have realized the who of the glow much sooner. 
“Anna?! What are you doing here?”
“I’m here because of you Madelyn. You saved me. You told me to build a box with handles, and I did. Without you I’d be stuck in the box forever, trapped and lonely for an eternity. You made me believe that life was worth living, that people can be kind and giving. You showed me love can come after I thought my loving was done. I thought my heart was too heavy to bare, but it was a thought from a thinker in desperate despair. Something happened that opened my eyes. It showed me all the good inside.”
Some thoughts in Madelyn’s thinker bounced about. After a bounce or two a few stuck together, and suddenly she discovered the answer to her wonderings.
“It was you at the pond above the willow.” She said. Anna smiled and nodded her head. “How can that be when I left you at the fiery creek?” 
“As you probably know by now I sent Glenn to the willow to get rid of the broach. Something wonderful happened, and it was more important than ever for me to keep what little blue was left in me. We believed if he could rid the broach from memory we would be safe, free from the flames.” Anna sighed as she continued.
“I walked up the path, past Mr. Blue, across the creek, and over the hill the whole time hoping I would see him smiling on his way back. My hope ended as the willows branches opened and I stepped in. The leaves circled as I entered. All around me I heard whispers…”
“Look it’s her. It’s her.” “I told you she would come” “Oh my poor dear.” “Look. How will she take care of it on her own” “Quiet. Remember we haven’t told her.” “That’s right she still doesn’t know.”
“Have you seen Glenn?” I asked and something louder than a whisper said “We have. In fact he was here just hours ago.”
“I’d like to see him please.” 
The branches rustled as the cold breeze hustled in. “I’m afraid it’s not so easy.” Said one voice. “He’s no longer in Loch Blue.” 
“That’s not possible. I’ve been watching the path. If he came back to town I would have known.” I said.
“He didn’t go back on the path.” The willow spoke.
“If he’s not here and he didn’t go back then exactly where is he” I asked
“He went back, just not on the path.” The willow replied.
“What is going on here? Please stop with the games. I just want an explanation.”
Suddenly I was surrounded by whispers again. “We have to tell her eventually.” “Too true” “It won’t hurt any less later.” “We might as well do it now.”
The whispers faded away. Replaced by a louder voice. “Perhaps it would be best if you sat.” The branches behind me started twisting and binding to form a deep blue seat.
“No thank you. I think I’ll stand. Now please tell me where is Glenn?” 
As you know he brought us your broach and pleaded with us to forget it. To remove your heart from memory. It requires a powerful magic to do such a thing. He would need to give us his blue in exchange. He hastily agreed to the deal before we told him the price. He was willing to accept any fee to forget it seems. He gave us your heart and the blue in his eyes. We helped him forget and sent him far away.
I could not believe it was true. I could not accept that Glenn would trade the heart that I gave him so he could forget me.
“You’re lying.” I yelled.
An angry voice replied. “I am the willow. Blue is truth and I have every shade of blue. I do not lie. Everything I told you is correct.”
Well then it must have been a misunderstanding. Perhaps it was me he was talking about. He might not have realized he would be kicked out.
The whispers resumed. “It seemed pretty clear.” “Yes quite obviously his intent was to forget.” “He must have known what would happen” “Certainly. Everyone knows the law of loch blue.”
They stopped when I shouted “I do not care what you say. I do not care what you saw. I know Glenn and most of all I know this is not something he has done!”
“Fine” the louder voice declared. “If you will not believe what we say, then see for yourself what happened when we offered the choice.” The breeze was replaced by howling wind. It blew through the branches swirling all around. Suddenly thousands of leaves fell at exactly the same moment. Before they could touch ground the gust caught them and blew them into a circle. Then the circle started to tighten into a tiny tornado.
Finally it started to take shape, a perfect leaf replica of glenn was standing right ahead. 
“This is him as he stood here just hours ago. If you don’t believe me, see for your self.” Said the voice
Leaf Glenn came to life and said 
“I accept”
“Consider your choice closely. You do know what happens when you lose your blue?”
“Of course. I will be back where I began with no memory of Loch Blue. I don’t care. It doesn’t matter anyways. As long as you remove the heart from memory, and finally get rid of her fire.”
“You accept so quickly? Don’t you want to know how far back the forgetting will go?” 
“Not really. No.” 
“Normally you would forget all the years between now and when you began. But we are romantic, and because of your love we’ll only take one.”
“I understand, but it doesn’t matter anyway. Now do what you have to do.”
“Strictly speaking she only told the truth. But she only told the truths that suited her scheme. It was a very hard lesson. One for which I paid deeply. Just because someone isn’t telling a lie, you mustn’t assume their point of view points to the complete truth. Selective sharing can be misleading, and partial honesty can be quite deceiving. There I stood young and alone. How could I have known what the willow’s honesty was plotting for me?”
It was a good thing the chair was still behind me. Falling into it saved me from falling on the ground. I had nothing to say about what I’d just seen. There are no words for the weight that sank into my shoulders. My world was turned. Everything that felt so real was suddenly in question. Before I could grasp which questions to ask, the willow asked one of me. 
“I am sorry you had to see that, but as I said I are romantic as well. Perhaps there is something we can do to help.”
A voice on my right came to life. “We can send you out on your own, back to the place we sent Glenn. In spite of everything you’ve seen you could try to make him fall in love with you again. This option comes with a cost. If you choose to go out there, you may never return here. Your way back to Loch Blue will be forever forgotten.”
“What are the odds of her changing his mind?” The whispers came back to life. “None from what we have seen.” “It was obvious where his heart resides” “Such a long trip just to be rebuffed.”
“There must be another option” I pleaded
The voice on my left spoke again. As it happens there is another path you can choose. I should warn you should you decide to choose to change Glenn, you may leave here forever on a hopeless endeavor. One thing is truer than any truth I have told, no one and nothing can alter the way Glenn Bend feels about you. No matter what you say or change, his feelings for you will always stay the same. 
.There is very little time before the speck of blue still left leaves and the fire will consume you. I can see why you need help so badly. Two hearts is a heavy responsibility. Trust me. I can see you are hurting and if you’ll let me. I can make it so you will never feel pain again. You will never again get burnt. I promise I will keep both hearts safe. If you agree, I will even keep your last speck of blue safely here with me. 
“What do you want in return?” I asked
“Nothing of course. As I said I am a romantic. I have watched you pay a monstrous cost already today. I ask nothing from one whose love was so recently lost. All you need do is say I accept.”
In that moment every thing felt bad, like it always would and always has. I’ve regretted it every moment since, but I whispered “I accept”
No sooner had I said it then the Glenn shaped leaves lit up in flames. I made to run away, but as the flames got closer I noticed I didn’t feel any pain. They flew and swirled, until suddenly they were covering me. The flaming leaves burnt from tip to toe. A moment later they turned to ash and blew away. And I was covered in flames.
What are you doing? I shouted out. “This wasn’t part of the deal.”
“Oh but it was. I promised you would never be burnt, and you never will. The burner can never be burnt. I promised you would never feel pain, and look you are not hurt from even the hottest of flames”
“I wanted those things, but not like this. I would never have accepted if I knew this was what you planned to do”
“A good lesson then. Next time ask more questions before you accept. That being said there is one more condition to fulfill. I promised to keep your last speck of blue safely here with me. It is a shame the rest of you can’t stay, but everyone knows the rules of Loch Blue. When I take your blue, the rest of you will be cast out, never to return. I am a romantic as you know. 
I have three gifts for you. To start I will return both parts of your heart shaped broach. Second I grant to you this crystal clear box. If ever you decide life has become too hard to survive, all you need do is place your heart inside it. It takes a few weeks to fully seal. 
I warn you the box has powerful magic to keep you from loss. The only way to stop once started is to cross half a crossing to the one you love most of all. Last and most important since you have two hearts to carry, You may keep your memory. Now go, and be grateful for my generosity.”
Before I could say anything more a gust of wind rushed by my face. When it came it was clear. When it left it was blue. Part of me was swept away by it too. Suddenly I was looking through two pairs of eyes. I watched the gust leave with my last speck of blue flying away towards the little lake. 
At the same time, I saw myself covered in flames. Burning brightly with anger and rage. Then with a crack it vanished, back to a creek far away from Loch Blue. I saw Glenn, and in my hatred I forced him away. I left the forest and walked the 32 bends until I found Redfield Creek. I lit the creek on fire and never left, until now.
So you were the lady I met at the lake past the willow? Madelyn asked even though she knew it was true. Anna smiled and nodded. “and this whole time you’ve been seeing through two pairs of eyes?”
“Yes, and at the same time not. The me at the creek could see quite clearly. The pair at the lake could only see the me at the creek. I saw everything I had said and done, but I saw it all from very far away. 
“I saw, but I could not speak. I heard, but I could not touch. I felt but I could not act. I watched as my world was consumed by fire. The flames grew, fueled by anger and rage until there was nothing left for me. That’s when I decided to seal my heart in the box” 
“That sounds horrific. I thought the willow promised you would never have pain. How could she lie and still survive?”
It took a moment for Anna to answer. Just enough time for me to tell you a very important truth. 
The thing you must know is pain comes in all flavors and shades. Some pains are painfully obvious to see. If you bump your nose or stub your toes you shout ouch, and everyone knows what your shouting about. When you sneeze and cough, when your head gets hot and your body hurts a lot, no one would complain if you if you couldn’t come out to play. Your friends might even bring you good food like a nice hot bowl of gray noodle soup. 
Those pains are easy to see, easy to talk about, and easy to treat. The thing about pain which is most important to know is… not all pains show. 
Some pains are widely felt and seldom known. It hurts a lot to break your arm, but really bad sadness or fear or loss, these things can be more painful by far. They are seldom seen and seldom heard, but at some time in our lives they are felt by us all. The secret I want you to know is, you never have to face them alone. 
Most times the key to getting better is letting someone know you are having a rough go. If you have the flu you might ask for a sweater. If you broke your leg you would definitely ask for a cast. If you get really sad or your fears are frighteningly fierce, the best way to change it, is always to say it. 
Unfortunately for Anna, the willow didn’t know not all pain shows. While she was protected from burns and bruises, the hidden hurt stayed, growing more painful every day. When Anna explained the same thing I’m saying to Madelyn in the cavern. Madelyn paused for a moment and then…
“But how do you know if the hearer will help? What if they don’t believe in pains you can’t see?”
“The sad truth is some people don’t. If you ask for help, they won’t. The happy truth is everyone who needs help knows at least one someone who will. It’s different for every person. It might be a doctor, a barber, or an uncle or a father, we all know someone we can go to who is willing to believe in the unseen.”
Madelyn was suddenly very disappointed. She didn’t have a doctor, a barber, or a father. She said so quite sadly “What about me? I don’t have any of those things.”
Anna replied softly “Think of all the people you’ve met since the day you left grayville. If you asked for help do you think there is at least one person who would believe?”
Madelyn went back to the day she asked Pa where he found color in a world of gray. She remembered the red glow coming from redfields creek, and sitting with Anna on the shore. She remembered twirling on the cliff when she found out the 33rd bend was Glenn. And her stay at Loch Blue! Lauren and Orvin and Herblan too. She knew the great Groggle, last of his kind understood there is often more inside than what meets the eye. She realized in all her travels only the willow could not see the truth. She concluded, even Mr. Bluelamp would be happily helpful if he had some time to think things through.”
She guessed it was one of those questions that don’t need and answer. Instead she smiled wide enough for Anna to see her across the cavern and asked, “After the willow was gone, when I came to the lake, you said I set you free. Where did you go? And how did you know where to me now?
When you destroyed the willow you broke its hold. She was sly and cunning. She was dangerous and cruel, and when we asked her for help deception was all we received. The whole town of Loch Blue believed her deceptions to be true. We all want to be good and honest. 
The willow told us we were, and that was that. No one wanted to discover under it all she was twisting the truth. It is much easier to know wrong from right when it’s in plain sight. Blue was right and not was wrong. Since everyone in town had blue, none of us were all too quick to question her judgment. 
Madelyn tilted her head and scrunched her nose a bit. “In all that time no one stopped to ask wether the willow was right? Someone had to notice something was wrong.”
“Most of us did, but no one asked questions because deep down we feared she was wrong. If that was the case who’s to say we weren’t all really dishonest monsters pretending to be honest and good. I think we all knew she twisted the truth, but in her twisted truth we were all honest and good. The willow proved we weren’t. Blue is truth, and in some way we all had blue. The comforting feeling of knowing you’re a decent human being stopped our questioning. We really did not want to know what the willow really was. A mistake I realized to late” 
“And I changed that?” Madelyn asked feeling much prouder of her encounter with the willow. With a wide, warm smile Anna replied.
“Madelyn, everything changed when you came along. Your bravery and honesty broke the willows bonds on us all. When I left you I roared down the river to redfields creek. I followed the flames until I came to the bank. For the first time since the willow stole them both pairs of eyes were staring at each other. Slowly they came together. One hand reached out another raised to meet it. One touched the other, and suddenly I was one again. Two arms, two legs, one head, and for the first time in years I saw through only one pair of eyes.” 
“You never said how you knew to come here.”
“You are a very clever girl. I bet you already know.”
Madelyn thought for a moment hoping she was as clever as Anna believed. Just then a grumbling in her tummy told her she was quite hungry. The next thought in her thinker was of dinner the night she stayed with the Lauren and Orvin in Loch Blue. Next was Lauren’s pies, then the pie guys with their towering carts, the one after that was the note Glenn had given to Zeb.
“The note from Glenn” She said. “Zeb brought you the note from Glenn to say where we were
But you stayed honest when you knew what the cost would be. 
I asked her to take away my pain so I’d never be burnt again. The instant I agreed to her pact I started to see through two of me. I was staring forward, and I was staring back. She used her magic to split me, the fiery creature you met at redfields creek and the lady made of water you freed near Loch Blue. 
She gather all the good, the love and kindness and caring and bound that part of me to the pond. I saw, but I could not speak. I heard, but I could not touch. I felt but I could not act. I didn’t know what I was trading away when I accepted her deal. I never knew when I gave her my blue I would lose a part of me as well. 
Since the burner never gets burnt she covered what was left of me with flames and fire. She poured in all of my rage and all of my anger. The meanest, darkest parts of me collected in a body bright and blazing. The willow made a binding pact, I wouldn’t get burnt. I wouldn’t feel her magic flames, but they would keep anyone else away. It was true, I’d never get burnt again. I no longer felt hurt or sorrow or pain. She replaced them all with anger and rage. 

“That sounds awful Are there still two yous?” Madelyn asked. 

No, everything changed when you came along. Your bravery and honesty broke the willows bonds and set me free. The caring side of me roared down the river to redfields creek. I followed the flames until I came to the bank of the creek. Suddenly staring with two sets of eyes one walked slowly to the other. I reached out one hand and touched it with another. Suddenly I was whole again. Two eyes, two arms, to legs, and one head. Now I could love and hurt again, and I saw the beauty in both. 

“What do you mean?” Madelyn asked

We hurt when we lose the things we love, but only because we love them so much. Every day the whole world changes. Here’s something to never forget. Every change is bad if you constantly worry about the bad changes coming. Worrying alone does that. It is not about changes in the future. It’s changes in the now. Something bad might happen tomorrow, so instead of worrying just live, love, and enjoy today. 

In that moment Madelyn remembered standing on the edge of the unknown worried about the path ahead. She remembered then deciding to forget the rest and just take a step. Anna’s voice interrupted her remembering. It sounded different than before, more vulnerable and less sure.

I need your help Madelyn. Some of the willow’s magic still exists, and I’m still trapped in the box. If I don’t escape in the next three days, I’ll be stuck inside for all the days after. 

“Of course! What can I do?”

“The magic was meant to keep others away. It stopped all who came to seek redfields creek. All except you. There’s only one way to break the box. I must touch the one I love the most.”

“No problem!” Madelyn said. “My friend groggle is already building a bridge. He’ll be finished soon and we can use his.”

“It may not be so easy” Anna said “The willow had powerful magic I don’t understand, but I bet there’s a few surprise yet.”

____ They talked through the night about the willow. Her interaction with Anna. Her interaction with Madelyn ___

A little spot of light lit up a dot on the floor. It came from a small hole in the ceiling overhead. It meant that it was morning.

“Look it’s morning! “It’s morning!” Madelyn jumped up and cried “I have to go get glenn and Herblan. They are going to be so excited to see you. And I can’t wait for you to meet Groggle. He’s a rumirock, the last of his kind.”

Anna smiled brightly as she stood up. Before each started walking back through the cave on their side of the canyon, Anna looked at Madelyn. She seemed joyful and at the same time sad. Like she was lost in a memory from the past. She seemed to snap back and she said “Madelyn I’ve seen happens when people deal with partial truths. Every word I said is true, but I haven’t told you all the truth. The parts I left out are the best, but they are not mine alone to tell. 
Notes
Remaining Plot Outline
***  This is a mix of written story and plot outline. It starts with the reunion of Anna Glenn and Madelyn spending a great day (or two) together doing fun magical things together (like waterballoon flowers).  Then when Madelyn overhears she’s their daughter, she runs away and meets the gardener who helps her understand before she returns to meet Anna at the bridge.  
Morning Day 1
Anna and Madelyn return to see morning. 
Anna sees Herblan and Glenn and is introduced to Groggle. 
Anna explains she is in a box and must meet halfway across the creek to touch. Groggle - no problem, I have two hands. The box is really heavy. Groggle can only hold Anna with two hands. They try two more bridges both collapse. Groggle catches with great effort he lifts her up. Groggle says he’ll be back.
“No problem” Boomed Groggle’s deep voice. “I have two hands. If you stand on one and Madelyn the other, I will bring you together halfway and break the curse in time for you to enjoy the rest of the day.”
“Thank you Groggle, but until the willow’s magic has broken I’m afraid I may be too heavy even for you to bare.”
“Nonsense” said Groggle as he placed his hand palm up on the ground. “Climb on, and I’ll show you how.” When Anna stepped onto Groggle’s hand, Madelyn could swear she saw the great stone face cringe. He grunted and groaned, but the giant stone hand stayed planted firmly to the ground. He had to grab his wrist and pull with both hands to lift Anna, and even then it was only an inch.
“I see what you mean” said Groggle as Anna climbed down. “No problem. You can walk down the canyon and cross one of the Rumirock bridges built by my kind” Madelyn could see Anna still had her doubts. Nevertheless she followed along with the rest. They quickly came to a crossing, and with a great big smile Groggle said, “This should do the trick. My father built this bridge” 
Anna stepped on the bridge, and as soon as she did the stone shattered and the cables snapped. For one horrible moment it looked like Anna was falling with the rest, but Groggle quickly caught her. With both hands and a massive heave he hefted the heavy weight to place her back safely. 
“Hmmm” Groggle frowned a bit. He thought some and said, “No problem. The bridge my great grandfather built is much stronger than this.” 
It may have been stronger but stronger it seemed would not be strong enough. With one step Anna sent the whole thing toppling down. Groggle caught her and once more hefted her back to safety. 
And so it went from bridge to bridge. Each stronger than the one before, but none strong enough to support such a heavy weight. They had quickly run out of options. Groggle paused and said “This could be a problem.” Madelyn felt quite helpless. Groggle saw the feel on her face and added, “I need some time to think, but I promise this is a problem I can solve.”
Madelyn truly believed Groggle would succeed, but an uneasy feeling left her wondering if he could complete his thinking in time to save Anna. 
Evening day 1
Pa arrives. 
Anna, Madelyn, Glenn, and pa have dinner together. Pa explains he is Anna’s dad. He left to find the Garden and got stuck in blind creek until he saw Annas fire. 
Morning day 2
Groggle has giant nails as tall as the canyon. He bangs one in for a long time to test. Anna steps on it, it sinks down, but it works. Groggle starts working to get the rest of them finished.
Afternoon day 2
Mud fight in the caves
Evening day 2
Madelyn overhears Pa, Anna, and Glenn talking about when to tell her they were her parents. She runs away and meets the gardener.
Loud sounds came down the cave. She came closer and started to make out two voices. One deep and one high. Both very serious and very stern.
“I am not ready to tell her yet.” Came a high voice that had to be Anna.
“We can’t hide this from her forever. It’s too important. She needs to know.” The voice was definitely Glenn.
“I know she needs to know, but not right now.” Anna echoed from across the opposite side of the cave.  
“You don’t understand.” Said Glenn, “I’ve been with her for all this time and every moment feels a little like I am living a lie. I’m tired of hiding the truth from her.”
“No YOU don’t understand.” Anna yelled back. “The next two days might be my last, and for the first time we are together and happy. I do not want to risk anything happening to change that.”
“Stop saying that Anna!” Glenn yelled back. “The next two days are not going to be your last. I can promise you that. We are going to be together and happy for years to come. The time to tell Madelyn is now. Besides, you know you need her to break the spell. She needs to know how, and more importantly she needs to know why.”
“No I refuse to tell her now! And that is that.” Anna snorted
“Fine. If you won’t I will!” Glenn retorted
“I forbid you fr\om telling her!” Snapped Anna
“You can’t forbid me from telling her she’s my…” Whatever word followed was lost and never heard as Glenn was distracted by a giant clatter.” 
Madelyn it seems was so focused on sounds and hearing she completely forgot about feet on the ground. Had she known the rock was slick she might have stepped of it, but as she leaned in to hear better the wetness got the best of her. Madelyn slipped, her legs tangled, she scraped her knee and twisted her ankle, before she tumbled out in the open. She scrambled to her feet to find Glenn and Anna facing her. 
A funny thing about seconds, they aren’t as timely as they seem. One would think each had an equal length, but one would think wrong. You see, a second can go by in a flash, like when you are playing games or having a laugh. Not many know, but sometimes a second can take much longer, like waiting for a pie to be done in the oven. As it happens the next four seconds were the longest of Madelyn’s life.
Glenn’s wide eyes wrinkled his forehead. His jaw dropped and his mouth opened almost as if he was going to speak, but no sounds came out. Madelyn thought of saying something herself, but no sayings came to mind. How strange that ten little words could consume all the thoughts in her thinker. All the thoughts came to fast to understand. Like trying to hear one violin in an orchestra with forty. Some were growing clearer, when suddenly one rose above the rest. It was loud, it was urgent, it was ‘get out’. So she split. She ran down the cavern, and the last voice she heard before the sounds returned to a jumbled muttering was “It’s okay. Just give her some space.” It was true she wanted space, but Madelyn was very sure nothing was okay.
She ran out of the cave and right by Herblan, Pa, and Groggle. She chanced a quick glance back at some very confused faces. As she stopped on top of a cliff looking down at the valley very far below. She forgot the bridges that had been there before, now were not. Madelyn needed space, but as it turned out she would not have a lot. Except when she turned in defeat dragging her feet as she began the walk back she noticed something she hadn’t before. Once again there was a hidden entrance she’d never noticed before. If the light weren’t just right it would be hard to spot with the sharpest of eyes. Now it stood before her,  gloriously obvious. She took the chance to escape and ran down the path full steam ahead to leave what she’d heard behind.
Still, as Madelyn ran she heard Glenns words over again and again. Each time they started the same ‘You can’t forbid me from telling her she’s my…’ and each time Madelyn tried out the word Glenn meant to end the sentence with. 
Friend came first, but Glenn had told her that many times before. It wouldn’t matter to Anna if he said it once more. Guest came next, but she suspected it was wrong. Afterall she’d never been to Glenn’s home. She tried chum and pal and buddy, but none seemed to make much sense. She even tried all the mates; school, class, room, and play. None of those words explained why Anna and Glenn acted the way they did. Only one word, the one she saved for last, made any sort of sense. 
I bet you’ve guessed it by now, but the next word she would have heard had the ground not been covered in water, is daughter. One little word brought the pieces of her life together fast. So fast in fact that she began to wonder why she hadn’t done it before. The only words left, the ones that came to her next were mother and father.
She thought of the look in Glenn’s eyes after she found him at the creek and helped him to see his imagined monstrosity was only Herblan trying to help him sleep. The way he made sitting on a log by a creek feel like home. Madelyn had watched enough families to see what it is like from the outside. As she looked back and imagined the past with someone else in her place. It was painfully clear and easy to see Glenn treated her like a father treats his daughter.
Looking back it was plain to see the same thing in Anna. Behind the fire in her eyes there was always a look reserved for a mother and her daughter. When she told her the story of the willow. The two hearts they bargained were not jewelry. One was Annas and the other her baby. 
“The baby was me.” Came a loud thought from her thinker. “I was her baby and she gave me away.” Shouted another. “She was so close to grayville, but in all those years she never came to see her daughter. And Pa” She thought. “All that time he lied about who he was. He hid it from her. He hid it from her for her entire life.”
It wasn’t just Pa. Orvin and Lauren must have known as well. Glenn obviously did after he got his memory back again. Every person she knew, from Grayville to Loch Blue had either lied or hid the truth. The only exceptions were Groggle and Herblan but they didn’t count. Groggle didn’t know, and she got the feeling even if Herblan could speak he probably would have kept it from her as well.
Grandma, grandpa, mother, father, daughter. To Madelyn in that moment all those words meant the same thing, she wasn’t wanted. Even with her newly found family, Madelyn had never been so lonely. “If no one wants me, there must be something wrong with me.” She decided. Her decision left her with one question “What is wrong?” 
The thing about thinkers is they tend to seek answers to whatever the question may be. When Madelyn asked what was wrong with her, every thought in her thinker offered a new reason for what it might be. No answer is right if the question is wrong. She would have been much more happy had she simply known more about the situation before she settled on a question. Sometimes the better question to ask is, ‘what happened’?
As soon as the tear hit her cheek Madelyn did a most unthinkable thing. She ran. Away from her mother, away from her father, she ran. So did the thought in her thinker that said the only thing her search for the garden had got her, was to know that she was an unwanted daughter.
She ran and ran through the canyon as it curved around and over her head when suddenly, Thump. She ran right into the rump of a man who moments before was bent down attending to a row of dirt on the ground. 
“I’m sorry!” She yelled over her shoulder as she sped forward But as she glanced back over her shoulder something told her she should stop for a moment. So she turned around to help the poor man off the ground.
She found him sitting, fiddling with the dirt. But for some reason, it didn’t seem right to offer to help him stand, so she hiked up her skirt and sat down instead. The man didn’t look up and didn’t say a word. When Madelyn asked his name, it seemed as if he hadn’t even heard what she’d said. In fact, if it weren’t for the motion of his hands as they danced across the dirt, toiling with the smallest of weeds to make a free space to place seeds in the soil, she would have sworn he was asleep. 
Madelyn watched as he deftly swept a dozen or so from a bag at his back and placed each one in a tiny hole he had dug. When he was done with those he swept up another. Moving inch by inch around Madelyn as she sat watching him turn up the ground hiding seeds in little mounds of fresh turned dirt. 
She wasn’t sure why, but Madelyn had no desire to do anything more than stay in that spot and watch. Hard as she tried not to close her eyes though, she dozed off a couple of times. The man was digging slightly to her left as her eyelids closed and she slept. When she woke she found the man on her right-hand side slowly planting rows like spokes from a wheel. Apparently Madelyn was the hub for as he circled and returned to her front, he sat down, smiled and said “All Done”
Madelyn blinked and wondered if all this was just in her thinker, when for the first time, the man looked in her eyes. “Now, Madelyn Blue-Eyes, I imagine there’s a question or two you’d like to ask. I’d be happy to share any answers I have. No more hesitations or speculations. Whatever you ask I’ll give the facts if I know them, and if not my very best guess.”
Madelyn blinked again, “NO. I mean, no thank you. I’ve had more than enough facts and answers from strangers, and not a single one has brought anything good to my life! All the facts and answers come down to one undeniably clear truth, I was never wanted in this world. I’m as useless as this dirt, just a silly little girl in a silly little skirt.”
“Oh little angel, I hope I can change your mind with my answers and facts. I think you’ll find I may be strange, but I’m far from a stranger.”
“Far from a stranger? When I don’t even know your name? You’re right, I do find that strange.”
“Oh but where are my manners. I beg your pardon, they call me the gardener.”
If you wake each day and worry that something bad may happen it already has. The worry is worse than the bad. But if you wave and say goodbye to them you can free up some space to go make a change. Morning can paint with blues and reds and yellows, but its canvas will always be the blackness, without it you’d never notice the difference between a wide sunny sky and a bright starry night. 
There’s only so many thoughts in your thinker, so make sure you know if those thoughts go to fear or to hope.
You wouldn’t believe the trouble it caused Mr. Bluelamp to discover his shade was actually teal. They listened to the whisper of the willow’s wind because to them it spoke of something good within. How could they know the within was without the truth?
Then grow me a home! I don’t care about the garden, just make me a place of my own where I’m loved and wanted.
No Madelyn, it’s your crop. You must attend it. It’s your own garden to plant and hoe, to water and grow. A garden must be started and it is the seeds you drop here and there that grow to be such wonderful trees. I plant my gardens, give them some time and water and a place to grow and when they are ready, I step back to watch and see what they will grow to be. 
I give them a place of their own in the world, but they must grow as they see fit. Some grow tall and beautiful and others are swept up by a breeze to plant more seeds. Much like the drop, they will be churned and turned and swept to the side. But it’s only when you fly and look at the beauty of the land below, that you’ll be able to see the garden, your home. 
I’ve sowed and plowed many rows in many grounds, but it’s my opinion that you are the greatest thing ever grown in my garden.
I wasn’t enough to be wanted by them. I could never be able to do what you do it’s far too large a job for one as small as me. 
Yes perhaps, but every journey starts with a step and if you’re patient you never know what will happen next. Then he sat on the spot she’d been sitting before and would you believe he shot right up and turned to a tree! He bowed and said, “Remember Madelyn, You already know what you call the unknown, but you don’t know the things that you think that you know.”
Morning day 4
Madelyn returns. Anna tells her about the time they had together, why she gave her to pa (what kind of life would that be?) and the broach was a sign for her to find if she wasn’t content with grayville. 
Evening day 4
Time is running out. Anna has an idea. She can hop from one nail to the next to get finish the bridge. Madelyn tells Glenn to hurry across. Glenn tells Madelyn she is the one Anna loves the most. Anna makes to halfway and barely touches Madelyn. Anna’s eyes return to blue with a little spec of ƒire
Across the bridge they turn to find blue eye bridge it is what it is.
Madelyn stops to see the Gardener again. 
*** It’s all a mess after this. These are chopped up pieces, some are from older storylines. I’ll try to clean it up, but there should be a lot of stuff mixed throughout to help better explain the relationship between A,G,M, Pa, and the willow.

Madelyn thought it quite strange that she should say together again as she had never been with Anna and Glenn at the same time. She was so happy Anna was here the strangeness vanished away. As she stepped out of the cave with the wood and the boulder beside she looked to the sky, waived to the morning.

I believe the willow’s deceptions have done more than she intended. To break the curse trapping your mother she must learn that love requires the loved ones to meet halfway. She must lay down her guard and let someone in. To see this she must be met by the one she loves the most. She will only know it is safe to place her heart with another when she tries and finds the one she loves has met her halfway. 

“Glenn you have to run to the bridge. She has to touch the one she loves halfway.”
“Madelyn I’m not the one she loves the most. You are. You have been since the day you were born and you will be until the day she dies. Go quick. You must save her.” 
For an instant Madelyn thought morning had come early, as she stared down Glenn’s finger to see the first rays of glowing red. When the glow got closer Madelyn held her breath hoping it would be who she guessed. 
It just so happens, she guessed right. Bursting with brightness from out of the trees she saw Anna through  the fire! Madelyn’s heart leapt with joy. And then it leapt again. This time to awe. Anna’s hair flickered off her shoulder and down her back. It wasn’t quite on fire, but it was glowing brightly, blowing this way and that. Which was quite strange to see when every other flower, twig, and tree was about as still as could be. 
“Anna! Anna!” Madelyn shouted and waved her hands. Anna’s face brightened and she quickened her pace. She stopped at the edge of the canyon right across from Madelyn. 
“Madelyn my darling girl. You have been so very brave and courageous.” 
“I was afraid you were locked in crystal clear box with no latches, no knobs, and no key. I’m so happy you’re here… and free.”
“There is no place else I’d rather be. I am afraid I am not exactly free. At least not completely. The last time we spoke you told me I should build a box with handles.  Do you remember?” Madelyn nodded.
“I watched as you followed the creek down all of its bends. When you reached the last, I knew you were in good…” 
 
Anna’s gaze shifted and for an instant it was as if Madelyn didn’t exist. She followed Anna’s gaze behind to see Glenn walking closer. When he was close enough to hear and be heard Glenn smiled and said “Hi Anna”
 
“Glenn” was all Anna said.
 
There’s a funny thing about sayings and words. The thing heard is rarely the word, but the way the saying was said; fast or slow, high or low, with a smile or a scowl. Our mouths and faces can sometimes lie, but  between you and me, the truth of our meaning lies in our eyes. If you really want to know what someone means, look at where they see.
 
Madelyn did, and she found the scaredness and sadness from before weren’t there anymore. There was a glow in Anna’s eyes, and Madelyn was fairly sure it wasn’t the fire. The only time she’d seen anything like this before was the first time Lauren looked at Orvin after the willow was gone.
 
I wanted to shout at you to come back, but you were better off without me. I walked across the creek. I placed my heart in the box. I had almost sealed the box with fearsome fire, but suddenly I remembered something I hadn’t before. 
 
If you believe in me, then so do I.
 
“That I might find a flower or a song to make it a little lighter and help me along.” 
 
Madelyn, you are my flower. You are my song.”
 
 
 

Only one person can touch me now is you. In order for the spell to break I must come back to you. I must bring the box to you. My heart is so heavy groggle couldn’t lift me and the bridge cannot hold me.“So you remember?” Anna asked.     
A tear dropped from her eye, and Madelyn couldn’t help to wonder if that drop could talk. “You’ve been such a brave girl on your journey. I know you’ve faced many scary things and learned so much lately, but you have become such a wondrous little lady. Before we say another word, I want you to know that I love you much more than anything else in this world.”
Madelyn didn’t quite know if she should speak then or not, but the words of the tree came into her head. You don’t know the things you think that you know. So even though she thought she ought to talk, she decided instead to not, since once again it might be better to have no knows for now.
She watched Anna’s eyes move from side to side, until it seemed she’d spied what she was looking for. Madelyn turned to follow her gaze and found it pointed to where Glenn Bend sat on a log with his arms on his knees. He seemed different than he had before. He like a happy cheer had just been drowned in an ocean of fear. He twirled a leaf in his hand and stared down. If it weren’t the way he cocked the ears on his head, it would’ve appeared that he wasn’t aware of the goings that had just gone on. Madelyn glanced back at Anna and saw the fearful cheerishness in her as she started to fidget with the sleeve of her dress.
“Glenn?” Anna asked timidly, differently then Madelyn had heard her speak any other word before.
“Yeah. It’s me, Anna” Glenn said differently than ever before as well.
“Is he still…?” Anna asked, but before she could finish Glenn had dropped the leaf and moved his hands so Anna could see what was beneath. It was a furry little ball with bright shiny teeth turned up in a smile.
“Herblan!” Anna shouted with a delight no words can describe. Herblan bounced and prounced and bounced again untill he arrived at Anna’s side. She scooped him up over her head into the moonlight and admired his smile as it widened. She quickly sat him on her should and looked over the other to Glenn once again.                                              
“Everything.” Glenn replied.

*** Explanatory conversation between Anna, Glenn, Madelyn, and Pa 
Anna: I just had you. The Broach was killing me,
Madelyn: Yeah but why did you get split into two parts your blue eyes and your fiery body? 
Glenn: Well that starts with me, I took that stupid broach to the willow. I told her I wanted to get it far away from your mother and you, far away from loch blue. I made a deal with her. She told me she could get me to the one place I could get rid of it forever. A cliff … and one inch. She told me to take Herblan along. It would come at a cost, the blue in my eyes would be lost. I didn’t realize without my blue I wouldn’t remember it, I wouldn’t remember you. 
Anna: She told me He begged her to send him back, and surely he knew what that meant. Maybe he took the broach so he could sell it.  
Anna: I was so devastated I didn’t know how I was going to take care of you alone. I don’t want anyone to ever harm us again. You will never feel another bad thing. You will have peace and you will never again get burned. She promised me you would be safe and that we could be together. 
Anna: You, this wonderful being surrounded by fire, cooing and unsinged. I saw you through my reflection in the pond. I could not feel you, or smell you, I only felt the flame. It was the most wonderful time of my life, we would sit in the creek and you would splash in the flames for hours. You used to chase this poor hare all over the place singing his poor tail. We laughed and played and set the mountain on fire. 
Anna: That’s how my father saw us from blind man’s creek. 
Grandpa: It was only a day before I knew I must turn back around.  I turned right into blind man’s creek. My vision was gone. I had plenty of food and water. I wandered for years stuck with the tall muddy banks. Still I tried and I wandered because that’s what a father does for his daughter. 
For the first time I saw my daughter and that’s when I found pleasure and stardom and wealth. And you, my darling granddaughter. You would bounce and play.
“What that reflection reflected was all that was left of  the feels that I felt. It was the part of me that knew to put the fire out, but I was trapped. It burned and it flared as I stared through someone else's eyes. I couldn’t see through the flames and the blue that remained behind was just a reflection. So I sat watching the sun project the most precious moments upon the waters each dawn, but I was all hollowed out and soon enough they were gone. Only the flames lived on. But you came to me and you gave me what I thought I had forever lost. That night the true you exposed the blue willow’s ways.
I once asked Lauren why people said that the blue willow was known to be the utmost authority of truthiness and wisdom. ‘Some people believe that no one has ever known the blue willow to tell a lie, and so they think perhaps blue is shown on the out when truth consumes the within, and at some point decide that since every tree, every limb, every branch and every single piece of the willow’s leaves are blue, the willow must truly be the only truth.’. When I asked what she believed, she said ‘the most astounding and confounding thing you’ll find is the ability to make your own mind. Do not take it lightly and hold as tight as can be to the knowledge that playing or swimming or sitting or dreaming, you are making, and you are creating. You see minds can be made like baking a pie. You can choose to use a recipe, a strongly braided bundle of thoughts with all the feels packed like jelly inside or one with fillings and feels that spill over and around surrounding the golden, flakey crust. 
How could you decide which recipe to use? Which ingredients should to choose?
Why child. All of them of course. Take every berry you eat, and the smells of the trees and sounds of the bees you can see when you sit in the grass on a calm autumn day. Take all of it, every last bit and, once you have those ingredients, have fun! experiment! I know you like the pies I make, but there’s hundreds more you’ll never taste. Orvin still complains of the days I spent only using ingredients from the trees and the lake. The fig, fish, and fowl pie lived up to it’s name, and the pickled, hickory herring was truly horrendous, but if memory serves me correct your favorite pie, the chestnut and cranberry cream, came to be somewhere in between. 
The secret to making a really great mind is to never stop baking. I’ve made so many thousands of pies and I don’t need recipes, just ingredients I like, and a few to avoid.
————
Madelyn stood under the arch looking at the night sky. She saw as the flames reflected through the blue stone overhead. The night was getting colder and older and bits of the mist were seeping and soaking down to her bones. She was just a silly little girl in a silly little skirt on dangerous heights except there was no part now that wanted to dance. She wished she had stayed with plain old gray. She wished she had never left home. All her knowings were now known, and all she knew was she was hopelessly alone. Even the feels that had bounced so loudly before had escaped. The tears that were hers to keep seemed to have sneaked away. She stood on the bridge looking down as the mist rolled up and off the ground. It seemed to block out her sight. She looked back up and just then a strange thing glistened in the jewel above. The reflection of the fire started to fade. It fogged over and got foggier and foggier until in one little spot the fog was so foggy it became a drop. The drop slid and hung at the top of the arch. “Hello Madelyn, It looks as though you and I seem to steer towards the very high heights.”  it said with a smile. 
“you lied! you told me that the path I chose would be neither wrong nor right! Now I’ve been churned and turned and swept to the side, stuck on a bridge by myself in the middle of the night. I’m not like you, I can’t just fly away. I can’t even see through this mist to find my way back down. 
Madelyn, look where I slid down the face of this stone. What do you see?
Madelyn stared at the reflection of the flames in the night blue stone. As she traced the line of the drop on the stone with her eyes, another slowly rolled down her cheek. The tear, and the last of Madelyn’s hope fell and bounced down to the canyon floor below. “Fire” she croaked and staring down at her toes she started to sob “Morning won’t make it through this mist. I’m stuck forever staring at this stupid light. It’s just a bright reminder of what might have been if I had chosen a different path.”
The drop chuckled “Is it really as bad as all that?” His laughter made Madelyn madder than she ever knew she could be. “Is this funny to you? Is this what you do? when you’re bored or to pass your time? Come and spy on silly little girls while their silly little worlds burn down?” 
The ripply smile straightened to the most serious face a drop can make. “Madelyn You wondrous marvelous girl. I don’t lie. The path you chose was neither wrong nor right. It left you alone on a bridge in the night with nothing but fading flames in sight, but remember the way the river flows. The bridge you stepped on is not the same you’ll step off. Look closer. That’s not the reflection of flames in the night. I’ve seen more high heights than the stars left in the sky, but there isn’t any other spot or any other who than you that I’d rather have be right here with me to greet the sun on its rise. Wrong or right, this little drop is very happy you chose the path that led us back to each other again.
Which is why, as your friend, I demand that you pull together your past endeavors and finish the final crossing of the great guild of the Rumirock kind!”
Groggle seemed to think it over for a while before he said, “Yes Ma’am” and set off down the canyon presumably to bring back a part of the bridge. And bring it back he did. Madelyn sat with Glenn and Herblan they watched as cables crossed suspensions that were anchored with care to gilded girders and ridged beams. Finally, Groggle passed with the last piece left. He hefted the heavy archway on the far side of the canyon as they all glanced at the completion of the contraption that hung over the chasm. Madelyn was lost for words though when Groggle looked back to find that all his life’s work combined still left a large gap between this side and that.  
He gave a gritty grin, as Madelyn looked closer and saw he seemed to be grasping a bulging bulk of stone between his massive hands. Squeezing with the great girth of his fingers wrapped around until he finally uncurled his clutch and revealed the most beautiful blue stone anyone had ever known. He placed it at the top of the arch for the sun and the moon to shine through and bathe travelers in a soft blue light as they make their way across. 
“There,” He said as he stood beside the creative collage of constructions. “All done.”
“It’s wonderful,” said Madelyn trying to understand if Groggle had noticed the gap that made the bridge quite impassable. Did she dare ask after all the work he had done how he expected them to get across?
Suddenly Glenn dared to ask what she had not. “It’s gorgeous big guy, I’ll grant you that, but one step off that gap and a traveler like me would be flat as a pancake by the creek on the canyon floor. Which, I’m sorry to say is a crossing that would leave most crossers quite cross.” 
The ground seemed to lurch as Groggle tossed back his rocky head and let out a great laugh. “You’re a funny man Glenn Bend.” Groggle said. “Don’t worry about the gap, I’ve already thought of that. I’ll lend you a hand and you can cross with ease as you please.” 
groggle between them in the canyon, bridge is unbuilt, anna comes from the trees on the other side saying thank god I found you, there’s still time… Glenn you must remember it all. We just have to put out the fire. Waiittt! roared goggle as his massive hand flew up to fill the gap from before. Anna began to run out of the flames across the bridge when… smack.
Anna stepped back as if she had walked into a pane of cold hard glass, but what lay ahead and between was a fearful wall of magic fire. It was too late. The box with handles had shut. Herblan’s shadow from the flames draped over as Glenn knelt on the ground staring at his two foot view of two shoes. Groggle created the last great bridge of the rumirock kind his face now and forever nothing more than stone was smiling widely and Madelyn felt like crying. He would never know that the bridge was built a bit too late.
She turns to see the sun rising behind glenn and herblan, back up at the drop as it falls on her forehead. The mist lifts as it turns to clouds and rain falls hissing to steam. A breeze blows and lo and behold there stands Anna.
Madelyn glanced down and saw a crystal clear box with a latch and two handles. It’s only a broach 
As they stepped off the bridge on the far side, Madelyn let out a cry. They turned to see the stony face of Groggle, now just a statue with a smile etched on its face. On his back, a plaque that read “Blue-Eye bridge. IT is what it is” 

Purple Pond - Originally the reunion between Glenn, Anna, and Madelyn 
*** When I started, I imagined once you passed Rumirok Canyon and down the mountain there was a pond where the big reunion would take place. I cut it out because of length, and I like the idea of ending on a mountain top looking down over everything. 
And so it was that a man, a little girl, and a squirming germlan came across the pass to peer upon purple pond. The strange thing was, Madelyn had seen it before. Not like this and not from above, it was from below peeping out of Grayville’s bounds. 
Madelyn spent most of her time at Grayville looking out. you could see the little grey shimmer of a pond.
From way up here it suddenly struck Madelyn that she could see her home again. Or at least the closest to one she’d known. To her dismay, far beyond the purple pond she peeped the land of gray. Worst of all, Purple Pond… was a medium shade of gray.
She could peep all the way to the seam between land and sky there was no Garden to be peeped. Madelyn felt a wearisome feel as the distance between here and there became dizzyingly real.
We won’t make it Glenn, she said with a shaky voice. It’s just too far for us to go.
To be quite frank, she was a bit of a grump. Even seeing Herblan dive into the pond and splash around couldn’t take away the small frown sprouting on her face. 
Chapter
She watched as gray waves in a gray pond lapped onto a gray shore, wondering what was in store, when she noticed that the water where the creek pours into the pond was turning a pale shade of blue. She jumped up as exciting feels overflowed the frown from before. 
“Glenn, the pond!” She yelled “The pond is turning blue!” But just like her encounter with the Misty Steps, it quickly fell back, astounded by the sight ahead. Out of the trees stepped the old man from the edge of town. He was covered from tip to toe in wet towels, although some had dried by now, and a few had started to singe. She cringed when she saw that his hand was grasped by a flaming ball of fire. 
When she looked closely she saw a beautiful hand there grasping back. All that she saw besides that was a crystal clear box with no latches or handles. Even the hand that held that was drowned by the fire surrounding.
“Anna!” Madelyn called, “Anna I’m here! It’s me Madelyn.” It was as if she couldn’t hear her. The old man guided her to a spot on the shore. She stared into the water for quite some time. Even on the other side Madelyn hid behind her sleeve from the heat. Anna looked up and stared into Madelyn’s eyes. Then she bent down and hard as she could she sent the crystal box flying high above the pond. It smashed down upon a rock in the middle Madelyn hadn’t seen before. The box and 2 parts of a heart shattered against the stone. The pieces sank into the pond’s uknown. Anna bent again, and this time she dove into the deepest part of the pond. For a moment it seemed like the pond had caught fire. Flames replaced waves bursting from shore to shore. There was a great hiss and the air became thicker than it was at the Misty Steps. 
A strange breeze blew bye and brought the steam along, and a beautiful woman with soft skin and a kind smile stepped out of the pond. This woman was not on fire. In her eyes was neither fear nor sorrow. Her eyes contained something Madelyn had never seen. It’s wasn’t a blue or a green or a red or any other color she knew. It was by far the most beautiful of any color she’d so far seen. She looked up astounded when she found that the pond had become the same color.
Glenn bent down. “That my dear is the purple pond.” He smiled.
—
Madelyn ran to Anna who opened her arms and swooped her around squeezing as tight as can be. She kept holding on for what seemed like forever, until finally Herblan sneezed and Anna seemed to remember where she was. She crouched in front of Madelyn and stared at her eyes like they were some kind of window to Madelyn’s inside.
“Madelyn, my darling girl,” she whispered, “You’re even more beautiful without flames in the way.”
— 
Something very odd followed. A bettin’ fellow would tell you that the most likely thing to happen when one long lost love finds the other involves lots of kissing and hugging, but that bettin’ fellow hasn’t always followed all the facts. In fact, in this instance instead of hugs and kisses, the lovers seemed to forget the other was there and stare instead at Madelyn’s head. She peeped back to see if something had creeped from the pond, but as far as she could find there was nothing else behind her. Tiny drops fell from 4 sets of eyes and the old man, Herblan, Anna and Glenn seemed to be smiling and crying at the exact same time!
But why? Madelyn had some questions, and I’ll bet you do too. She had loads for Anna, and more for Glenn, but when she peeped the Old Man and she knew with no doubt where to begin.
“I’m rather ashamed,” she said to him, “I’m afraid I’ve never asked you your name.”
“No, I don’t suppose you would have. Even if you had I wouldn’t have answered back. You couldn’t know before, but this old man’s name is Stan.”
“Why couldn’t I know before now?” Madelyn demanded.
“There’s a lot to tell and understand, but for now the best I can say is that this old man named Stan, is also Anna’s Dad.”
Madelyn became more confused than before. It wasn’t a satisfying answer. It was only the door to more. Glenn suggested they build a pit for a fire, and everyone jumped to get tinder, twigs and sticks. Madelyn stayed on the ground, while Herblan dropped down to do the best he could to lighten her brow. There would be no lightening this night it seemed, or at least not right now. Madelyn’s brow was weighed down with all the thoughts bouncing in her thinker. They felt like turbulent waters trying to sink her, and Madelyn wondered if you could drown in thoughts in your own thinker.
She felt a warm glow grow on her shoulder and down her back. Glenn motioned for her to come join them, so Madelyn walked to the fire wondering if he’d still keep his promise to take her to the Garden.
As she approached Glenn and Anna bade her to sit in a spot between them. Madelyn cleared her own seat instead. You see, Madelyn could count the people she trusted on just one hand. If you count Herblan then one hand and a thumb. The Bluesocks from Loch Blue were two, but they clearly were there and not here. Looking across at these “trustworthy” friends, Madelyn had the feeling that she was down to just one thumb around. Herblan the Germlan must have felt similarly for he hopped off their log and onto her knee.
He tells of how her grandfather went looking for a grandmother who died and left the baby with him. He knew Mr. Bluesocks paced the forest before writing so he placed her where he would find her. He set Herblan nearby and added blue to the lake. Perhaps the garden will come to you here’s a quiet place to wait with no colors so you can spot it when you see it. When he wakes up, the old man was gone and the baby was in a basket. He found the old man lost in blind man’s creek so he told him to go back to Grayville and follow the sun and moon. 
He told him she would give him the brooch and that he should wear it every fall. There was a lot of sadness surrounding this tale, but two people had been in love. Mr. Bluesocks and Lauren had the child they always wanted, and an old man found his true desire in a basket. The love of an angel surrounded by fire. Now it was up to Madelyn what would become of the story. She could be overcome by weeds and spread their seeds. She could become a beautiful flower that would wilt in the winter inside. Or she could take his place as the gardener and tend to the world she lived in. 
Madelyn walks back towards Grayville to a hill with brush as it starts to rain and sits to cry. Mr. Blue walks up. He knows now who he is and he wants to return the favor. He tells her he thinks she knows who she is too. She looks again at her reflection and notices a few things and then as morning comes she proudly shouts I am what I am and it is what it is, but with little steps and some patience it will become what I make it! As she shouts her loved ones are nearby and shout it is what it is! It spreads and as she waves to morning she sees the most beautiful rainbow spread over Grayville. Only, when she waved at morning this time, it seemed to wave back. It is what it is she thought, and IT didn’t feel half bad.
I am not the Angel you wish me to be! I try and try to keep the fire from where the basket lies, but day after day it’s harder to restrain the painful inferno that’s boiling within. The old man came along and she gave him the basket and half the brooch. 
She told him to leave and protect her basket and half the brooch. If Madelyn asked he could send her to the creek, if not she should live a happy life in Grayville. Annabella starts to explain that she is Madelyn’s mother when Glenn gets mad an accusatory rhyme until mother but don’t say it. She dashes off until she runs into the gardener. Glenn seemed to comprehend something then, but whatever it was she couldn’t grasp it. 

She said she could do it, but she would need the blue in my eyes to do so. Suddenly 
I asked her please, don’t do this You must cross to me 
The part they left out was I did not go to the willow alone.  For all my attempts to be different I was just the same. People in Grayville are quite pleasant, you would be safe and you would never need to see me like this. If you could find the life I did and be happy like I was, I would not take that from you.  
Groggle is ripping off all of the half started bridges and laying them down right before Anna jumps on them and hammers them into place He took 3 giant stones and all the metal and made a giant nail. You said that’s pretty heavy ma’am, think it’s enough to pound them in? You must try groggle. 
So Anna ran, so gracefully Madelyn half hoped she would just float, and yet as groggle placed the giant stone and rock nails the ground rumbled right up from the creek at his feet to the sides of his cheeks. 
They touched when Anna jumped across to touch Madelyn, and then the fog came in all around, madelyn looked down at the sight of her shoes. Anna is in groggles hand The last piece of the bridge in his hand, and his hand in place of the piece.

Do not take it lightly and hold as tight as can be to the knowledge that playing or swimming or sitting or dreaming you are making, and you are creating. You see minds can be made like baking a pie. You can choose to use a recipe, a strongly braided bundle of thoughts with all the feels packed like jelly inside or one with fillings and feels that spill over and around surrounding the golden, flakey crust. 
How could you decide which recipe to use? Which ingredients should you choose to use?
Why child. All of them of course. Take every berry you eat, and the smells of the trees and sounds of the bees you can see when you sit in the grass on a calm autumn day. Take all of it, every last bit and, once you have those ingredients, have fun and experiment. I know you like the pies I make, but there’s hundreds more you’ll never taste. Orvin still complains of the days I spent trying only to use from the trees and the lake. The Fig fish and fowl pie lived up to it’s name, and the pickled hickory herring was truly horrendous, but if memory serves me correct your favorite pie, the chestnut and cranberry cream, came to be somewhere in between. 
The secret to making a really great mind is to never stop baking. I’ve made so many thousands of pies, and I still have no recipes just ingredients I like, and a few to avoid.
